# Getting started with DQOps Data Quality Operations Center
This guide provides a quick tutorial on how to get started with DQOps using the web interface. You will add a data source, run data quality assessment, automatically configure data quality checks,
review the results and create an incident notification for data quality issues.

## Sample data
In the example, we will import a CSV file with a sample fragment of the [public dataset of a fictitious ecommerce clothing site TheLook](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce). 

Next, we will run data quality assessment, automatically configure data quality checks to find the most common data quality issues,
review the results and create an incident notification for data quality issues.

Finally, we will review the data quality results on the [data quality dashboards](../dqo-concepts/types-of-data-quality-dashboards.md). 

!!! note "DQOps offers a wide range of connection options"

    In this getting started guide, we use the CSV file connection since there is no need for additional database configuration.

    However, DQOps supports [integration with different types of data sources](../data-sources/index.md) for monitoring the data quality.


## Steps

1. [Local installation](installation.md)

2. [Add a data source connection and start data quality assessment](add-data-source-connection.md)

3. [Review results from data quality assessment, automatically configure data quality checks and create incident notification](review-results-and-run-monitoring-checks.md)

4. [Review the results on data quality dashboards](review-results-on-dashboards.md)
