# Quick start with DQO
This guide contains a quick tutorial on how to get started with DQO using the graphical interface. 

In our example, we add connection to the [BigQuery public dataset Austin Crime Data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-austin/austin-crime), 
run 2 types of [data quality checks](../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md) and review the results on the [data quality dashboards](../dqo-concepts/data-quality-dashboards/data-quality-dashboards.md).
