# Getting started with DQOps Data Quality Operations Center
This guide provides a quick tutorial on how to get started with DQOps using the web interface. You will add a data source, analyze it, and review the data quality results. 

## Sample data
In the example, we will import a CSV file with a sample [public dataset Austin Crime Data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-austin/austin-crime). 

Next, we will run and review [basic statistics](../working-with-dqo/collecting-basic-data-statistics.md), 
and automatically added profiling and monitoring [data quality checks](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md). 

Finally, we will review the data quality results on the [data quality dashboards](../dqo-concepts/types-of-data-quality-dashboards.md). 

!!! note "DQOps offers a wide range of connection options"

    In this getting started guide, we use the CSV file connection since there is no need for additional database configuration.

    However, DQOps supports [integration with different types of data sources](../data-sources/index.md) for monitoring the data quality.


## Steps

1. [Local installation](installation.md)

2. [Connect to a data source](add-data-source-connection.md)

3. [Review the initial results and run monitoring checks](review-results-and-run-monitoring-checks.md)

4. [Review the results on data quality dashboards](review-results-on-dashboards.md)
