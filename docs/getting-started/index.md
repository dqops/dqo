# Getting started with DQOps
This guide contains a quick tutorial on how to get started with DQOps using the web interface, analyze a data source, and review the data quality results. 

## Sample data
In the example, we will add a **connection to a CSV file** data source. 
The file contains a sample of [BigQuery public dataset Austin Crime Data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-austin/austin-crime). 

Next, we will run and review [Basic statistics](../working-with-dqo/collecting-basic-data-statistics.md), 
and automatically added profiling and monitoring [data quality checks](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md). 

Finally, we will review the data quality results on the [data quality dashboards](../dqo-concepts/types-of-data-quality-dashboards.md). 

!!! note "Diverse connection options in DQOps."

    The CSV file connection is used in this *getting started* guide because no additional database configuration is needed.

    The list of [data sources supported by DQOps](../data-sources/index.md) shows the connection screens to
    analyze data quality of other databases. 
    The steps to connect to a different data source are the same as described in this *getting started* guide.


## Steps

1. [Local installation](installation.md)

2. [Connect to a data source](add-data-source-connection.md)

3. [Review the initial results and run monitoring checks](review-results-and-run-monitoring-checks.md)

4. [Review the results on data quality dashboards](review-results-on-dashboards.md)
