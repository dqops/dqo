The query for this check calculates the percentage of matching data with given regex from user.
It performed by using SQL function:

- REGEXP_CONTAINS() in bigquery.
- REGEXP_LIKE() in snowflake.

These functions return true if data matching with given regex, else functions return false.

Successfully classified records are assigned value of 1, and any other values, 0.
Those values are then summed (so the counting of valid values is effectively performed), divided by the number of records,
and multiplicated by a 100.0 so that the result is in percent.
