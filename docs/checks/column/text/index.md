# column level text data quality checks

This is a list of text column data quality checks supported by DQOps and a brief description of what data quality issued they detect.




## column-level text checks
Validates that the data in a text column has a valid range.

### [text min length](./text-min-length.md)
This check finds the length of the shortest text in a column. DQOps validates the shortest length using a range rule.
 DQOps raises an issue when the minimum text length is outside a range of accepted values.
