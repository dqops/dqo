# List of column level comparisons data quality checks

This is a list of comparisons column data quality checks supported by DQOps and a brief description of what data quality issued they detect.




## column-level comparisons checks
Compares the columns in a table to another column in another table that is in a different data source.

### [sum match](./sum-match.md)
A column-level check that ensures that compares the sum of the values in the tested column to the sum of values in a reference column from the reference table.
 Compares the sum of values for each group of data. The data is grouped using a GROUP BY clause and groups are matched between the tested (parent) table and the reference table (the source of truth).
