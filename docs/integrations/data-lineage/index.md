# Marquez Data Lineage and Data Quality Integration
DQOps has built-in data lineage, which allows users to easily trace data helping them identify the root cause of data quality issues more efficiently.

It helps organizations track data back to its source, making it easier to identify where quality issues begin by  
tracing to either faulty input data or mistakes in downstream transformations.

This transparency improves decision-making, strengthens data governance, and increases trust in the accuracy and consistency of data across the organization.
