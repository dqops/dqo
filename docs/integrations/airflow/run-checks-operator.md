# Airflow Operator for Running Data Quality Checks - DAG Example
Read this reference to learn how to use the Apache Airflow operator for running data quality checks inside a DAG, with the description of parameters.

## Overview

The Airflow run checks operator is used to execute checks configured on the DQOps platform.

A run checks task result contains a simple summary of the data quality that is available in the logs of Airflow task as well as XCom return value of the task.  

The operator provides parameters which allow setting the operator to a specific scope of attached checks on the DQOps platform. 
Over a dozen of parameters for a **precise selection** of prepared checks are available including connection names, particular table sensors, 
dimensions, check types and more.

The run checks operators are working **synchronously**, so Airflow will wait for the end of execution. 
To prevent endless execution, the operator supports a timeout parameter.
**Asynchronous** work of the run checks operator is also possible when is used with [wait for job operator](./wait-for-job-operator.md).

There are 4 operators for running checks:

- **DqopsRunChecksOperator**: Generic run checks operator for all types of checks.
- **DqopsRunProfilingChecksOperator**: Run checks operator for running [profiling type of data quality check](../../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/data-profiling-checks.md).
- **DqopsRunMonitoringChecksOperator**: Run checks operator for running [monitoring type of data quality check](../../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/data-observability-monitoring-checks.md).
- **DqopsRunPartitionedChecksOperator**: Run checks operator for running [partition type of data quality check](../../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/partition-checks.md).


## Operator parameters

Operator parameters can be treated as filters that limit the scope of checks that are run.
When none of the parameters are set, possibly all sensors will be run.  

!!! tip "Use of multiple parameters"

    You can mix the parameters to run checks, for instance: 

    only partition checks from timeliness dimension on tables with name that contains "customers" literal.

| fail_on_timeout       | By default, exceeding the timeout limit causes the status of the task to end with the Failed status. By setting the flag of this parameter to True, the status of the failed task will result in the Success status.                                                                                                                                                                  | bool                                                                                                                    |
| fail_at_severity      | The threshold level of rule severity, causing that an Airflow task finishes with failed status (values: RuleSeverityLevel.VALID, RuleSeverityLevel.WARNING, RuleSeverityLevel.ERROR, RuleSeverityLevel.FATAL).                                                                                                                                                                        | [RuleSeverityLevel](../../client/models/check_results.md#RuleSeverityLevel) [optional, default=RuleSeverityLevel.FATAL] |

The operator inherits from BaseOperator and adds the above parameters.

## Set up the run check operator

Entry requirements include:

- Installation of python package from PyPi called dqops
- Configuration of data source and checks in DQOps.

**DAG example**

The example sets a task to execute all profiling checks on "example_connection" connection every 12 hours. 
The operator connects to the locally started DQOps server.

```python
import datetime
import pendulum
from airflow import DAG
from dqops.airflow_operators.run_checks.dqops_run_profiling_checks_operator import DqopsRunProfilingChecksOperator

with DAG(
    dag_id="my_connection_dqops_run_profiling_checks",
    schedule=datetime.timedelta(hours=12),
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2023, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    run_checks_task = DqopsRunProfilingChecksOperator(
        task_id="dqops_run_profiling_checks_operator_task",
        base_url="http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        connection="example_connection",
        full_table_name="maven_restaurant_ratings.consumers"
    )
```


## Execution results

Airflow DAG provides logs to the executed tasks.   
The status details will appear in a one line as an info level log from the operator, which contains a JSON formatted response from DQOps presented below.

```json5
{
  'jobId': {
    'jobId': 1696833858000000, 
    'createdAt': '2023-10-09T06:44:18.519114400Z'
  }, 
  'result': {
    'highest_severity': 'valid', 
    'executed_checks': 3, 
    'valid_results': 3, 
    'warnings': 0, 
    'errors': 0, 
    'fatals': 0, 
    'execution_errors': 0
  }, 
  'status': 'running'
}
```

Executed job adds information to an Airflow task log as well as to XCom's "return_value" key. 
The executed task of run check type returns the RunChecksQueueJobResult object with execution details visible above.

When the task execution finished or not, the task instance in Airflow is marked as Success or Failed accordingly.
If the data quality is flawless the Airflow task run square will be filled with the green color on an execution view in the DAG.

!!! tip "Use of fail_at_severity parameter"

    The use of fail_at_severity parameter allows to define a level of severity which will control success of task. <br>
    In default only the task execution with fatal severity level fails marking the square as red. <br>
    For failing the task on an another level, set the fail_at_severity parameter with the apropriate [Rule Severity Level](../../client/models/check_results.md#RuleSeverityLevel)


RunChecksQueueJobResult includes:

- **job_id (DqoQueueJobId)**: Identifies a single job that was pushed to the job queue.
- **result (RunChecksResult)**: Returns the result (the highest data quality check severity and the finished checks count) for the checks that were recently executed.
- **status (DqoJobStatus)**: The job status.


## Job id

Job id has a type of DqoQueueJobId which includes job tracking details:

| name          | description                                               | type           |

| job_id        | Job id.                                                   | int            |
| parent_job_id | Identifies a single job that was pushed to the job queue. | DqoQueueJobId  |
| created_at    | The timestamp when the job was created.                   | int            |


## Result

Job result has a type of RunChecksResult with the overall summary of checks execution: 

| name             | description                                                                                                                                                                                                         | type                |

## Status

Status field is the DqoJobStatus enum, which have one of values:

- **cancelled**: The job was fully cancelled and removed from the job queue.
- **cancel_requested**: A request to cancel a job was issued, but the job is not yet cancelled.
- **failed**: The job has failed with an execution error.
- **queued**: The job is queued.
- **running**: The job is now running.
- **finished**: The job has finished successfully.
- **waiting**: The job is parked until the concurrency constraints are met.

## Long-running run check task

An approach is different in case of long-running Airflow tasks that take several minutes up to hours to be completed.

Instead of using a single operator, usage of WaitForJobOperator as an addition to the long-running task is necessary.

Check the [wait for job operator](./wait-for-job-operator.md) page for more details.
