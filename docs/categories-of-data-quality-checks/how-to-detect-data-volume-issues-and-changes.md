# Detecting data quality issues with volume
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to volume.
The data quality checks are configured in the `volume` category in DQOps.

## Volume category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to volume are listed below.

| [Detect empty or incomplete tables](../examples/data-completeness/detect-empty-or-incomplete-tables.md) | This example shows how to check that the number of rows in a table does not exceed the minimum accepted count using [row_count](../checks/table/volume/row-count.md) check. |

## List of volume checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*row_count*](../checks/table/volume/row-count.md)|Completeness|A table-level check that ensures that the tested table has at least a minimum accepted number of rows. The default configuration of the warning, error and fatal severity rules verifies a minimum row count of one row, which checks if the table is not empty.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*row_count_anomaly*](../checks/table/volume/row-count-anomaly.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that ensures that the row count is within a two-tailed percentile from measurements made during the last 90 days.| |
|[*row_count_change*](../checks/table/volume/row-count-change.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout.| |
|[*row_count_change_1_day*](../checks/table/volume/row-count-change-1-day.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from yesterday.| |
|[*row_count_change_7_days*](../checks/table/volume/row-count-change-7-days.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from last week.| |
|[*row_count_change_30_days*](../checks/table/volume/row-count-change-30-days.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from last month.| |


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/volume](../checks/table/volume/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
