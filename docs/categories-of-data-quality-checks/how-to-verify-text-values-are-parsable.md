## List of conversions checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*text_parsable_to_boolean_percent*](../checks/column/conversions/text-parsable-to-boolean-percent.md)|Validity|A column-level check that ensures that the percentage of boolean placeholder texts (&#x27;0&#x27;, &#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;true&#x27;, &#x27;false&#x27;, &#x27;yes&#x27;, &#x27;no&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27;) in the monitored column does not fall below the minimum percentage.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*text_parsable_to_integer_percent*](../checks/column/conversions/text-parsable-to-integer-percent.md)|Validity|A column-level check that ensures that the percentage of text values that are parsable to integer in the monitored column does not fall below set thresholds.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*text_parsable_to_float_percent*](../checks/column/conversions/text-parsable-to-float-percent.md)|Validity|A column-level check that ensures that the percentage of strings that are parsable to float in the monitored column does not fall below set thresholds.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*text_parsable_to_date_percent*](../checks/column/conversions/text-parsable-to-date-percent.md)|Validity|A column-level check that ensures that there is at least a minimum percentage of valid text values that are valid date strings (are parsable to a DATE type) in a monitored column.|:material-check-bold:|
