# Detecting data quality issues with nulls
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to nulls.
The data quality checks are configured in the `nulls` category in DQOps.

## Nulls category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to nulls are listed below.

## Use cases
| **Name of the example**                                                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |

| [Detect incomplete columns](../examples/data-completeness/detect-null-values.md) | This example shows how to incomplete columns that have too many null values using the [nulls_count](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-count.md) check. |

## List of nulls checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*nulls_count*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-count.md)|Completeness|A column-level check that ensures that there are no more than a set number of null values in the monitored column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*nulls_percent*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent.md)|Completeness|A column-level check that ensures that there are no more than a set percentage of null values in the monitored column.| |
|[*not_nulls_count*](../checks/column/nulls/not-nulls-count.md)|Completeness|A column-level check that ensures that there are no more than a set number of null values in the monitored column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*not_nulls_percent*](../checks/column/nulls/not-nulls-percent.md)|Completeness|A column-level check that ensures that there are no more than a set percentage of not null values in the monitored column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*nulls_percent_anomaly*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent-anomaly.md)|Consistency|A column-level check that ensures that the null percent value in a monitored column is within a two-tailed percentile from measurements made during the last 90 days. Use in partitioned checks.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*nulls_percent_change*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent-change.md)|Consistency|A column-level check that ensures that the null percent in a monitored column has changed by a fixed rate since the last readout.| |
|[*nulls_percent_change_1_day*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent-change-1-day.md)|Consistency|A column-level check that ensures that the null percent in a monitored column has changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from yesterday.| |
|[*nulls_percent_change_7_days*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent-change-7-days.md)|Consistency|A column-level check that ensures that the null percent in a monitored column has changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from last week.| |
|[*nulls_percent_change_30_days*](../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent-change-30-days.md)|Consistency|A column-level check that ensures that the null percent in a monitored column has changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from the last month.| |


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [column/nulls](../checks/column/nulls/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
