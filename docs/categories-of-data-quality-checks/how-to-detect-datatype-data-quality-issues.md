# Detecting data quality issues with datatype
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to datatype.
The data quality checks are configured in the `datatype` category in DQOps.

## Datatype category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to datatype are listed below.

How to detect datatype data quality issues.

## List of datatype checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*detected_datatype_in_text*](../checks/column/datatype/detected-datatype-in-text.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that scans all values in a string column and detects the data type of all values in a monitored column. The actual_value returned from the sensor can be one of seven codes: 1 - integers, 2 - floats, 3 - dates, 4 - timestamps, 5 - booleans, 6 - strings, 7 - mixed data types. The check compares the data type detected in all non-null columns to an expected data type. The rule compares the value using equals and requires values in the range 1..7, which are the codes of detected data types.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*detected_datatype_in_text_changed*](../checks/column/datatype/detected-datatype-in-text-changed.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that scans all values in a string column and detects the data type of all values in a monitored column. The actual_value returned from the sensor can be one of seven codes: 1 - integers, 2 - floats, 3 - dates, 4 - timestamps, 5 - booleans, 6 - strings, 7 - mixed data types. The check compares the data type detected during the current run to the last known data type detected during a previous run. For daily monitoring checks, it will compare the value to yesterday&#x27;s value (or an earlier date). For partitioned checks, it will compare the current data type to the data type in the previous daily or monthly partition. The last partition with data is used for comparison.|:material-check-bold:|


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [column/datatype](../checks/column/datatype/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
