# Percentage of false values

This example shows how to detect that the percentage of false values remains above a set threshold.

**PROBLEM**

[The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) political ads public inspection files dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/federal-communications-commission/fcc-political-ads)
contains political ad file information that broadcast stations have uploaded to their public inspection files, which are
housed on the FCC website.

This information is uploaded to the FCCâ€™s website in PDF form and not machine-readable. However, this dataset includes 
a content_info table that contains manual annotations of some data fields like advertiser, gross spend, ad air dates and
a link to a copy of the PDF, which can be found on Google Cloud Storage.

The `invalidOcr` column indicates if the OCR does match the raw file text (false value) or does not (true value). In case
of the true value, the OCR process needs more work and the file is not ready to be transcribed.

We want to verify the percentage of false values in the `invalidOcr` column, which will tell us what percentage of data is 
ready to be transcribed.

**SOLUTION**

We will verify the data of `bigquery-public-data.fcc_political_ads.content_info` using monitoring 
[false_percent](../../checks/column/bool/false-percent.md) column check.
Our goal is to verify that the percentage of false values on `invalidOcr` column does not fall below 99%. 

In this example, we will set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQOps concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

**VALUE**

If the percentage of data that is available for transcription drops below 99%, a warning alert will be triggered.

## Data structure

The following is a fragment of the `bigquery-public-data.fcc_political_ads.content_info` dataset. Some columns were omitted for clarity.  
The `invalidOcr` column of interest contains both TRUE and FALSE values.

| contentInfoId    | advertiser                     | grossSpend | infoSource | invalidOcr |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using the user interface

The detailed explanation of [how to run the example is described here](../../#running-the-use-cases).

To execute the check prepared in the example using the [user interface](../../dqo-concepts/user-interface-overview/user-interface-overview.md):

![Navigating to a list of checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/navigating-to-the-list-of-daily-false-percent-checks.png)

1. Go to the **Monitoring** section.

   The Monitoring Checks section enables the configuration of data quality checks that are designed for the daily and monthly monitoring of your data source.


2. Select the table or column mentioned in the example description from the **tree view** on the left.

   On the tree view you can find the tables that you have imported. Here is more about [adding connection and importing tables](../../working-with-dqo/adding-data-source-connection/index.md).


3. Select the **Monitoring Checks** tab.

   In this tab you can find a list of data quality checks.


4. Run the enabled check using the **Run check** button.

   You can also run all checks for the check category using the **Run check** button located at the end of the row with the name of the check group.

   ![Run check](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-false-percent-run-checks.png)


5. Access the results by clicking the **Results** button.

   Within the Results window, you will see three categories: **Sensor readouts**, **Check results**, and **Execution errors**. The Sensor readouts category
   displays the values obtained by the sensors from the data source. The Check results category shows the severity level
   that result from the verification of sensor readouts by set rule thresholds. The Execution errors category displays any error
   that occurred during the check's execution.

   ![Check details](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-false-percent-check-details.png)


6. Review the results which should be similar to the one below.

   The actual value in this example is 99, which is above the minimum threshold level set in the warning (99).
   The check gives a valid result (notice the green square on the left of the name of the check).

   ![False-percent check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-false-percent-check-results.png)


7. Synchronize the results with your DQOps cloud account using the **Synchronize** button located in the upper right corner of the user interface.

   Synchronization ensures that the locally stored results are synced with your DQOps Cloud account, allowing you to view them on the dashboards.

8. To review the results on the [data quality dashboards](../../working-with-dqo/data-quality-dashboards/data-quality-dashboards.md)
   go to the Data Quality Dashboards section and select the dashboard from the tree view on the left.

   Below you can see the results displayed on the KPIs per check category - summary dashboard showing results by KPI, KPI per category, Datetime KPI, Pii KPI and Standard KPI.

   ![False-percent check results on KPIs per check category - summary dashboard](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-false-percent-check-results-on-KPIs-per-check-category-summary-dashboard.png)

## Configuring a schedule at connection level

With DQOps, you can easily customize when checks are run by setting schedules. You can set schedules for an entire connection,
table, or individual check.

After running the daily monitoring checks, let's set up a schedule for the entire connection to execute the checks every day at 12:00.

![Configure scheduler for the connection](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/configure-scheduler-for-connection.png)

1. Navigate to the **Data Source** section.

2. Choose the connection from the tree view on the left.

3. Click on the **Schedule** tab.

4. Select the Monitoring Daily tab

5. Select the **Run every day at** option and specify the time as 12:00.

6. Once you have set the schedule, click on the **Save** button to save your changes.

7. Enable the scheduler by clicking the toggle button.

![Enable job scheduler](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/enable-job-scheduler.png)

Once a schedule is set up for a particular connection, it will execute all the checks that have been configured across
all tables associated with that connection.

You can [read more about scheduling here](../../working-with-dqo/schedules/index.md).

You might also want to check the [Running checks with a scheduler](../data-quality-monitoring/running-checks-with-a-scheduler.md) example.

## YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file stores both the table details and checks configurations. 

In this example, we have set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

The highlighted fragments in the YAML file below represent the segment where the monitoring `daily_false_percent` check is configured.

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQOps concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

```yaml hl_lines="16-29"
apiVersion: dqo/v1

            daily_false_percent:
              warning:
                min_percent: 99.0
              error:
                min_percent: 98.0
              fatal:
                min_percent: 95.0
```

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using DQOps Shell

The detailed explanation of [how to run the example is described here](../../#running-the-use-cases). 

To execute the check prepared in the example, run the following command in DQOps Shell:

``` 
check run
```

Review the results which should be similar to the one below.
The check shows a valid results what means that the percentage of false values in the `invalidOcr` column exceeds 99%.

```
Check evaluation summary per table:
+-----------------+------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|Connection       |Table                         |Checks|Sensor results|Valid results|Warnings|Errors|Fatal errors|Execution errors|
+-----------------+------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|fcc_political_ads|fcc_political_ads.content_info|1     |1             |1            |0       |0     |0           |0               |
+-----------------+------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
```

For a more detailed insight of how the check is run, you can initiate the check in debug mode by executing the 
following command:

```
check run --mode=debug
```

In the debug mode you can view the SQL query (sensor) executed in the check.

```

                WHEN NOT analyzed_table.`invalidOcr`
                    THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) / COUNT(*)
    END AS actual_value,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS time_period,
    TIMESTAMP(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS time_period_utc
FROM `bigquery-public-data`.`fcc_political_ads`.`content_info` AS analyzed_table
GROUP BY time_period, time_period_utc
ORDER BY time_period, time_period_utc
**************************************************
```

You can also view the results returned by the sensor. The actual value in this example is 99.95%, which exceeds the 
minimal threshold level set in the warning (99%).
