# Percentage of false values

This example shows how to detect that the percentage of false values remains above a set threshold.

**PROBLEM**

[The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) political ads public inspection files dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/federal-communications-commission/fcc-political-ads)
contains political ad file information that broadcast stations have uploaded to their public inspection files, which are
housed on the FCC website.

This information is uploaded to the FCCâ€™s website in PDF form and not machine-readable. However, this dataset includes 
a content_info table that contains manual annotations of some data fields like advertiser, gross spend, ad air dates and
a link to a copy of the PDF, which can be found on Google Cloud Storage.

The `invalidOcr` column indicates if the OCR does match the raw file text (false value) or does not (true value). In case
of the true value, the OCR process needs more work and the file is not ready to be transcribed.

We want to verify the percentage of false values in the `invalidOcr` column, which will tell us what percentage of data is 
ready to be transcribed.

**SOLUTION**

We will verify the data of `bigquery-public-data.fcc_political_ads.content_info` using profiling 
[bool_false_percent](../../checks/column/bool/false-percent.md) column check.
Our goal is to verify that the percentage of false values on `invalidOcr` column does not fall below 99%. 

In this example, we will set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQO concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

**VALUE**

If the percentage of data that is available for transcription drops below 99%, a warning alert will be triggered.

## Data structure

The following is a fragment of the `bigquery-public-data.fcc_political_ads.content_info` dataset. Some columns were omitted for clarity.  
The `invalidOcr` column of interest contains both TRUE and FALSE values.

| contentInfoId    | advertiser                     | grossSpend | infoSource | invalidOcr |

## YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file stores both the table details and checks configurations. 

In this example, we have set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

The highlighted fragments in the YAML file below represent the segment where the profiling `bool_false_percent` check is configured.

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using the graphical interface

The detailed explanation of how to run the example is described [here](../#running-the-examples).

To execute the check prepared in the example using the [graphical interface](../../working-with-dqo/navigating-the-graphical-interface/navigating-the-graphical-interface.md):

![Navigating to a list of checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/navigating-to-the-list-of-bool-false-percent-checks.png)

1. Go to **Profiling** section.

2. Select the table or column mentioned in the example description from the tree view on the left.

3. Select **Advanced Profiling** tab.

4. Run the enabled check using the **Run check** button.
   ![Run check](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/bool-false-percent-run-checks.png)

5. Review the results by opening the **Check details** button.
   ![Check details](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/bool-false-percent-check-details.png)

6. You should see the results as the one below.
   The actual value in this example is 99, which is above the minimum threshold level set in the warning (99.0%).
   The check gives a valid result (notice the green square on the left of the name of the check).

   ![Bool-false-percent check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/bool-false-percent-check-results.png)

7. After executing the checks, synchronize the results with your DQO cloud account sing the **Synchronize** button
   located in the upper right corner of the graphical interface.

8. You can now [review the results on the data quality dashboards](../../working-with-dqo/data-quality-dashboards/data-quality-dashboards.md) as described in Working with DQO section.


## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using DQO Shell

The detailed explanation of how to run the example is described [here](../#running-the-examples). 

To execute the check prepared in the example, run the following command in DQO Shell:

``` 
check run
```

You should see the results as the one below.
The check shows a valid results what means that the percentage of false values in the `invalidOcr` column exceeds 99%.

```
Check evaluation summary per table:
+-----------------+------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|Connection       |Table                         |Checks|Sensor results|Valid results|Warnings|Errors|Fatal errors|Execution errors|
+-----------------+------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|fcc_political_ads|fcc_political_ads.content_info|1     |1             |1            |0       |0     |0           |0               |
+-----------------+------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
```

For a more detailed insight of how the check is run, you can initiate the check in debug mode by executing the 
following command:

```
check run --mode=debug
```

In the debug mode you can view the SQL query (sensor) executed in the check.

**************************************************
```

You can also view the results returned by the sensor. The actual value in this example is 99.95%, which exceeds the 
minimal threshold level set in the warning (99%).
