# How to detect invalid latitude and longitude values using a data quality check
This sample shows how to use data quality checks to measure the percentage of valid latitude and longitude values and view the results on dashboards.

## Overview

The following example shows how to verify that the percentage of valid latitude and longitude values are above a set threshold.

**PROBLEM**

[Austin-311-Public-Data](https://data.austintexas.gov/Utilities-and-City-Services/Austin-311-Public-Data/xwdj-i9he) 
provides the residents of Austin with a simple single point of contact for every city department.

What started as police non-emergency line for the City of Austin has become a robust Citywide Information Center
where ambassadors are available to answer residentsâ€™ concerns 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

The dataset contain the list of service requests with unique key, descriptions, status, address as well as its longitude and latitude coordinates. 

We want to verify the percentage of valid latitude and longitude values in `latitude` and `longitude` columns, respectively.

**SOLUTION**

We will verify the data of `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests` using monitoring
[valid_latitude_percent](../../checks/column/numeric/valid-latitude-percent.md) and 
[valid_longitude_percent](../../checks/column/numeric/valid-longitude-percent.md) column checks.
Our goal is to verify if the percentage of valid latitude values in the `latitude` and `longitude` columns are above the set threshold.

In this example, we will set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQOps concept section](../../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md).

**VALUE**

If the percentage of valid latitude or longitude values is below 99%, a warning alert will be triggered.

## Data structure

The following is a fragment of the `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests` dataset. Some columns were 
omitted for clarity.  
The `latitude` and `longitude` columns of interest contains valid values.

## Run the example using the user interface

A detailed explanation of [how to start DQOps platform and run the example is described here](../index.md#running-the-use-cases).

### **Navigate to a list of checks**

To navigate to a list of checks prepared in the example using the [user interface](../../dqo-concepts/dqops-user-interface-overview.md):

![Navigating to a list of checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/navigating-to-the-list-of-daily-valid-latitude-and-longitude-percent-checks1.png)

1. Go to the **Monitoring** section.

    The **Monitoring Checks** section enables the configuration of data quality checks that are designed for the daily and monthly monitoring of your data source.


2. Select the table or column mentioned in the example description from the **tree view** on the left.

    On the tree view you can find the tables that you have imported. Here is more about [adding connection and importing tables](../../data-sources/index.md).


3. Select the **Daily checks** tab.

    This tab displays a list of data quality checks in the check editor. Learn more about [navigating the check editor](../../dqo-concepts/dqops-user-interface-overview.md#check-editor).


### **Run checks**

Run the activated check using the **Run check** button. Run checks on latitude and longitude columns. 

You can also run all the checks for an entire connection. Click on the three dots icon next to the name of the 
connection in the tree view and click on **Run checks**. 

![Run check](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-valid-latitude-and-longitude-percent-run-checks1.png)


### **View detailed check results**

Access the detailed results by clicking the **Results** button. The results should be similar to the one below.

![Valid-latitude-and-longitude-percent check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-valid-latitude-and-longitude-percent-checks-results1.png)

Within the Results window, you will see three categories: **Check results**, **Sensor readouts**, and **Execution errors**.
The Check results category shows the severity level that result from the verification of sensor readouts by set rule thresholds.
The Sensor readouts category displays the values obtained by the sensors from the data source.
The Execution errors category displays any error that occurred during the check's execution.

The actual value in this example is 99.24% for both longitude and latitude checks, which is above the minimum
threshold level set in the warning (99.0%).
The check gives a valid result (notice the green square to the left of the check name).


### **Synchronize the results with the cloud account**

Synchronize the results with your DQOps cloud account using the **Synchronize** button located in the upper right corner
of the user interface.

Synchronization ensures that the locally stored results are synced with your DQOps Cloud account, allowing you to view them on the dashboards.

### **Review the results on the data quality dashboards**

To review the results on the [data quality dashboards](../../working-with-dqo/review-the-data-quality-results-on-dashboards.md)
go to the Data Quality Dashboards section and select the dashboard from the tree view on the left. 
 
Below you can see the results displayed on the **Highest issue severity per check and day table** dashboard which is located in the
Highest issue severity per day group of dashboards. This dashboard allows for reviewing and filtering a summary 
number of issues that arise from data quality checks per day, grouped by [check category](../../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md#categories-of-checks).
    
This dashboard helps evaluate the areas with the highest number of data quality issues that should be addressed.
It also allows to review how the issue severity changed per day of the month.

This dashboard allow filtering data by:
    
* current and previous month,
* connection,
* schema,
* data group,
* data quality dimension,
* check category,
* check name,
* table,
* column.

## Change a schedule at the connection level

With DQOps, you can easily customize when checks are run by setting schedules. You can set schedules for an entire connection,
table, or individual check.

After importing new tables, DQOps sets the schedule for 12:00 P.M. (noon) every day. Follow the steps below to change the schedule.

![Change a schedule at the connection level](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/change-schedule-for-connection.png)

1. Navigate to the **Data Source** section.

2. Choose the connection from the tree view on the left.

3. Click on the **Schedule** tab.

4. Select the **Monitoring daily** tab

5. Select the **Run every day at** and change the time, for example, to 10:00. You can also select any other option. 

6. Once you have set the schedule, click on the **Save** button to save your changes.

    By default, scheduler is active. You can turn it off by clicking on notification icon in the top right corner of the screen, and clicking the toggle button.

    ![Turn off scheduler](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/turning-off-scheduler.png)

Once a schedule is set up for a particular connection, it will execute all the checks that have been configured across
all tables associated with that connection.

You can [read more about scheduling here](../../working-with-dqo/configure-scheduling-of-data-quality-checks/index.md).

You might also want to check the [Running checks with a scheduler](../data-quality-monitoring/running-checks-with-a-scheduler.md) example.

## YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file stores both the table details and checks configurations.

In this example, we have set three maximum percentage thresholds levels for the checks:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

The highlighted fragments in the YAML file below represent the segment where the monitoring `daily_valid_latitude_percent` and
`daily_valid_longitude_percent`checks are configured.

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQOps concept section](../../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md).

            daily_valid_longitude_percent:
              warning:
                min_percent: 99.0
              error:
                min_percent: 98.0
              fatal:
                min_percent: 95.0
```

## Run the checks in the example using the DQOps Shell

A detailed explanation of [how to start DQOps platform and run the example is described here](../index.md#running-the-use-cases).

To execute the check prepared in the example, run the following command in DQOps Shell:

``` 
check run
```

Review the results which should be similar to the one below.
The percent of valid latitude and longitude values is above the 99% and the checks results are valid.

```
Check evaluation summary per table:
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|Connection|Table                          |Checks|Sensor results|Valid results|Warnings|Errors|Fatal errors|Execution errors|
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|austin_311|austin_311.311_service_requests|2     |2             |2            |0       |0     |0           |0               |
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
```

For a more detailed insight of how the checks are run, you can initiate the checks in debug mode by executing the
following command:

```
check run --mode=debug
```

In the debug mode you can view the SQL queries (sensors) executed in the checks.

            ELSE 0
        END
    )/COUNT(*) AS actual_value,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS time_period,
    TIMESTAMP(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS time_period_utc

In this example, we have demonstrated how to use DQOps to verify the validity of data in a column.
By using the [valid_latitude_percent](../../checks/column/numeric/valid-latitude-percent.md) and
[valid_longitude_percent](../../checks/column/numeric/valid-longitude-percent.md) column checks, we can monitor that
the percentage of valid latitude and longitude values does not fall below a set threshold. If it does, you will get a warning, error or fatal resul
