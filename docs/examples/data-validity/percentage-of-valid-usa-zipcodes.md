# Percentage of valid USA zipcodes

Verifies that the percentage of valid USA zip code in a column does not fall below the minimum accepted percentage.

**PROBLEM**

[Austin-311-Public-Data](https://data.austintexas.gov/Utilities-and-City-Services/Austin-311-Public-Data/xwdj-i9he) provides the residents of Austin with a simple single point of contact for every city department.

What started as police non-emergency line for the City of Austin has become a robust Citywide Information Center
where ambassadors are available to answer residentsâ€™ concerns 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

The `incident_zip` column contains USA zipcode data. We want to verify the percent of valid USA zipcode on `incident_zip` column.

**SOLUTION**

We will verify the data of `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests` using profiling
[valid_usa_zipcode_percent](../../checks/column/pii/valid-usa-zipcode-percent.md) column check.
Our goal is to verify if the percentage of valid USA zipcode values in the `incident_zip` column does not fall below the setup thresholds.

In this example, we will set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQO concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

**VALUE**

If the percentage of zipcode values falls below 99.0%, a warning alert will be triggered.

## Data structure

The following is a fragment of the `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests` dataset. Some columns were omitted for clarity.  
The `incident_zip` column of interest contains valid USA zipcode values.

| city   | incident_zip | country | state_plane_x_coordinate | state_plane_y_coordinate | latitude    |
|:-------|:-------------|:--------|:-------------------------|:-------------------------|:------------|

|        | **78733**    |         |                          |                          |             |

## YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file stores both the table details and checks configurations.

In this example, we have set three minimum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 99.0%
- error: 98.0%
- fatal: 95.0%

The highlighted fragments in the YAML file below represent the segment where the profiling `valid_usa_zipcode_percent` check is configured.

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQO concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using the graphical interface

The detailed explanation of how to run the example is described [here](../#running-the-examples).

To execute the check prepared in the example using the [graphical interface](../../working-with-dqo/navigating-the-graphical-interface/navigating-the-graphical-interface.md):

![Navigating to a list of checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/navigating-to-the-list-of-valid-usa-zipcode-percent-check.png)

1. Go to **Profiling** section.

2. Select the table or column mentioned in the example description from the tree view on the left.

3. Select **Advanced Profiling** tab.

4. Run the enabled check using the **Run check** button.
   ![Run check](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/valid-usa-zipcode-percent-run-check.png)

5. Review the results by opening the **Check details** button.
   ![Check details](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/valid-usa-zipcode-percent-check-details.png)

6. You should see the results as the one below.
   The actual value in this example is 98, which is below the minimum threshold level set in the warning (99.0%).
   The check gives a warning (notice the yellow square on the left of the name of the check).

   ![Valid-usa-zipcode-percent check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/valid-usa-zipcode-percent-check-results.png)

7. After executing the checks, synchronize the results with your DQO cloud account sing the **Synchronize** button
   located in the upper right corner of the graphical interface.

8. You can now [review the results on the data quality dashboards](../../working-with-dqo/data-quality-dashboards/data-quality-dashboards.md) as described in Working with DQO section.

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using DQO Shell

The detailed explanation of how to run the example is described [here](../#running-the-examples).

To execute the check prepared in the example, run the following command in DQO Shell:

``` 
check run
```
You should see the results as the one below.
The percent of the valid USA zipcode values in the `incident_zip` column is below 99.0% and the check raised a warning.
```

+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|Connection|Table                          |Checks|Sensor results|Valid results|Warnings|Errors|Fatal errors|Execution errors|
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+

+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
```
For a more detailed insight of how the check is run, you can initiate the check in debug mode by executing the
following command:

```
check run --mode=debug
```

In the debug mode you can view the SQL query (sensor) executed in the check.
