# Percentage of duplicates

Verifies that the percentage of duplicate values in a column does not exceed the maximum accepted percentage.

**PROBLEM**

[Austin-311-Public-Data](https://data.austintexas.gov/Utilities-and-City-Services/Austin-311-Public-Data/xwdj-i9he) provides the residents of Austin with a simple single point of contact for every city department.

What started as police non-emergency line for the City of Austin has become a robust Citywide Information Center
where ambassadors are available to answer residentsâ€™ concerns 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

The `unique_key` column contains unique key data. We want to verify the percent of duplicated values on `unique_key` column.

**SOLUTION**

We will verify the data of `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests` using monitoring
[duplicate_percent](../../checks/column/uniqueness/duplicate-percent.md) column check.
Our goal is to verify if the percentage of duplicated values in `unique_key` column does not exceed set thresholds.

In this example, we will set three maximum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 1.0%
- error: 2.0%
- fatal: 5.0%

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQO concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

**VALUE**

If the percentage of duplicated values on `unqiue_key` column exceed 1.0%, a warning alert will be triggered.

## Data structure

The following is a fragment of the `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests` dataset. Some columns were omitted for clarity.  
The `unique_key` column of interest contains unique values.

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using the graphical interface

The detailed explanation of how to run the example is described [here](../#running-the-examples).

To execute the check prepared in the example using the [graphical interface](../../dqo-concepts/user-interface-overview/user-interface-overview.md):

![Navigating to a list of checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/navigating-to-the-list-of-daily-duplicate-percent-checks.png)

1. Go to the **Monitoring** section.

   The Monitoring Checks section enables the configuration of data quality checks that are designed for the daily and monthly monitoring of your data source.


2. Select the table or column mentioned in the example description from the **tree view** on the left.

   On the tree view you can find the tables that you have imported. Here is more about [adding connection and importing tables](../../working-with-dqo/adding-data-source-connection/index.md).


3. Select the **Monitoring Checks** tab.

   In this tab you can find a list of data quality checks.


4. Run the enabled check using the **Run check** button.

   You can also run all checks for the check category using the **Run check** button located at the end of the row with the name of the check group.

   ![Run check](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-duplicate-percent-run-checks.png)


5. Access the results by clicking the **Results** button.

   Within the Results window, you will see three categories: **Sensor readouts**, **Check results**, and **Execution errors**. The Sensor readouts category
   displays the values obtained by the sensors from the data source. The Check results category shows the severity level
   that result from the verification of sensor readouts by set rule thresholds. The Execution errors category displays any error
   that occurred during the check's execution.

   ![Check details](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-duplicate-percent-checks-details.png)


6. Review the results which should be similar to the one below.
   
    The actual value in this example is 0, which is below the maximum threshold level set in the warning (1.0%).
    The check gives a valid result (notice the green square on the left of the name of the check).

    ![Duplicate-percent check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-duplicate-percent-checks-results.png)

7. Synchronize the results with your DQO cloud account using the **Synchronize** button located in the upper right corner of the graphical interface.

    Synchronization ensures that the locally stored results are synced with your DQO Cloud account, allowing you to view them on the dashboards.

8. To review the results on the [data quality dashboards](../../working-with-dqo/data-quality-dashboards/data-quality-dashboards.md)
   go to the Data Quality Dashboards section and select the dashboard from the tree view on the left. 
 
    Below you can see the results displayed on the Issues count per check dashboard showing results by check category, check and failed tests.

    ![Duplicate-percent check results on Issues count per check dashboard](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/daily-duplicate-percent-checks-results-on-issues-count-per-check-dashboard.png)

## Configuring a schedule at connection level

With DQO, you can easily customize when checks are run by setting schedules. You can set schedules for an entire connection,
table, or individual check.

After running the daily monitoring checks, let's set up a schedule for the entire connection to execute the checks every day at 12:00.

![Configure scheduler for the connection](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/configure-scheduler-for-connection.png)

1. Navigate to the **Data Source** section.

2. Choose the connection from the tree view on the left.

3. Click on the **Schedule** tab.

4. Select the Monitoring Daily tab

5. Select the **Run every day at** option and specify the time as 12:00.

6. Once you have set the schedule, click on the **Save** button to save your changes.

7. Enable the scheduler by clicking the toggle button.

![Enable job scheduler](https://dqops.com/docs/images/examples/enable-job-scheduler.png)

Once a schedule is set up for a particular connection, it will execute all the checks that have been configured across
all tables associated with that connection.

You can [read more about scheduling here](../../working-with-dqo/schedules/index.md).

You might also want to check the [Running checks with a scheduler](../data-quality-monitoring/running-checks-with-a-scheduler.md) example.

## YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file stores both the table details and checks configurations.

In this example, we have set three maximum percentage thresholds levels for the check:

- warning: 1.0%
- error: 2.0%
- fatal: 5.0%

The highlighted fragments in the YAML file below represent the segment where the monitoring `daily_duplicate_percent` check is configured.

If you want to learn more about checks and threshold levels, please refer to the [DQO concept section](../../dqo-concepts/checks/index.md).

```yaml hl_lines="8-21"
apiVersion: dqo/v1
kind: table
spec:
  incremental_time_window:
    daily_partitioning_recent_days: 7
    monthly_partitioning_recent_months: 1
  columns:
    unique_key:
      type_snapshot:
        column_type: STRING
        nullable: true
      monitoring_checks:
        daily:
          uniqueness:
            daily_duplicate_percent:
              warning:
                max_percent: 1.0
              error:
                max_percent: 2.0
              fatal:
                max_percent: 5.0
    source:
      type_snapshot:
        column_type: STRING
        nullable: true
    created_date:
      type_snapshot:
        column_type: TIMESTAMP
        nullable: true
```

## Running the checks in the example and evaluating the results using DQO Shell

The detailed explanation of how to run the example is described [here](../#running-the-examples).

To execute the check prepared in the example, run the following command in DQO Shell:

``` 
check run
```
Review the results which should be similar to the one below.
The percent of the duplicate values in the `unique_key` column is below 5.0% and the check gives valid result.
```
Check evaluation summary per table:
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|Connection|Table                          |Checks|Sensor results|Valid results|Warnings|Errors|Fatal errors|Execution errors|
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
|austin_311|austin_311.311_service_requests|1     |1             |1            |0       |0     |0           |0               |
+----------+-------------------------------+------+--------------+-------------+--------+------+------------+----------------+
```
For a more detailed insight of how the check is run, you can initiate the check in debug mode by executing the
following command:

```
check run --mode=debug
```

In the debug mode you can view the SQL query (sensor) executed in the check.

```
**************************************************
Executing SQL on connection austin_311 (bigquery)
SQL to be executed on the connection:
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(analyzed_table.`unique_key`) = 0 THEN 100.0
        ELSE 100.0 * (
            COUNT(analyzed_table.`unique_key`) - COUNT(DISTINCT analyzed_table.`unique_key`)
        ) / COUNT(analyzed_table.`unique_key`)
    END AS actual_value,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS time_period,
    TIMESTAMP(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS time_period_utc
FROM `bigquery-public-data`.`austin_311`.`311_service_requests` AS analyzed_table
GROUP BY time_period, time_period_utc
ORDER BY time_period, time_period_utc
**************************************************
```
You can also see the results returned by the sensor. The actual value in this example is 0.0%, which is below the maximum
threshold level set in the warning (5.0%).
