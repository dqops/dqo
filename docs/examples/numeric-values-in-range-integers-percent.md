# Values in range integers percent

In this example we will check the data of `bigquery-public-data.america_health_rankings.ahr` using `values_in_range_integers_percent` check.
Our goal is to set up a reasonableness check on `edition` column in order to check how many percent of values
are within the indicated by the user range, in this case this is `2021 - 2022`.
