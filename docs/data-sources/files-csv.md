# CSV
Read this guide to learn how to configure DQOps to use CSV files from the UI, command-line, or directly in YAML files. All parameters are documented.

## Overview

You can utilize CSV files stored either locally or in cloud storage. 

The input table is generated by specifying either single or multiple files, or a directory containing CSV files.

## Prerequisite credentials

Additional configuration is required **only for using remote storage**.

Ensure that your account has access to the remote directory containing CSV files.
The permissions acquired should enable the listing of files and directories, as well as reading the content of files.
