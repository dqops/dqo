# How to set up data quality monitoring and data observability for Amazon Redshift
Data observability and data monitoring for Amazon Redshift. Detect schema changes, data anomalies, volume fluctuations, and other data quality issues.

## Overview

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud from Amazon Web Services.  
Redshift can handle analytic workloads on big data sets stored by a column-oriented DBMS principle

## Prerequisite credentials

To add Redshift data source connection to DQOps you need a Redshift account.

Amazon Redshift uses an elastic IP address for the external IP address. An elastic IP 
address is a static IP address. In case of restrictions, you need to add the IP address used by DQOps
to [Allowed IP Addresses in Redshift Network Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-clusters-vpc.html).

## Add an Amazon Redshift connection using the user interface

### **Navigate to the connection settings**

To navigate to the Redshift connection settings:

1. Go to the Data Sources section and click the **+ Add connection** button in the upper left corner.

[See the Redshift documentation for JDBC connection parameter references.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/jdbc20-install-driver.html)            |
   
DQOps allows you to dynamically replace properties in connection settings with environment variables. To use it, simply
change "clear text" to ${ENV_VAR} using the drop-down menu at the end of the variable entry field and type your variable.
    
For example:

![Adding connection settings - environmental variables](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/connection-settings-envvar.jpg)
    
To add optional JDBC connection properties, just type the **JDBC connection property** and the **Value**. The value
can be in the ${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME} format to use dynamic substitution.
    
For example:

![Adding connection JDBC settings](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/connection-settings-JDBC-properties2.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }
    
To remove the property, click the trash icon at the end of the input field.

After filling in the connection settings, click the **Test Connection** button to test the connection.

Click the **Save** connection button when the test is successful otherwise, you can check the details of what went wrong.


### **Import metadata using the user interface**

When you add a new connection, it will appear in the tree view on the left, and you will be redirected to the Import Metadata screen.
Now we can import schemas and tables.

1. Import the selected data resources (source schemas and tables) by clicking on the **Import Tables** button next to
    the name of the source schema from which you want to import tables.

    ![Importing schemas](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/importing-schemas.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

2. Select the tables you want to import or import all tables using the buttons in the upper right corner.

    ![Importing tables](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/importing-tables.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

Upon import, you will receive information that a new tables have been imported. You can then begin collecting basic statistics
and profiling data by running default data profiling checks. Simply click on the **Start profiling** button to initiate this process.

![Collect basic statistics and profile data with default profiling checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/getting-started/collect-basic-statistics-and-profile-data.png)

!!! info "Automatically activated checks"

    Once new tables are imported, DQOps automatically activates [profiling and monitoring checks](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md) which are which are pre-enabled by [data quality policies](../dqo-concepts/data-observability.md#automatic-activation-of-checks).
    These checks detect volume anomalies, data freshness anomalies, empty tables, table availability, schema changes, anomalies in the count of distinct values, and null percent anomalies. The profiling checks are scheduled 
    to run at 12:00 p.m. on the 1st day of every month, and the monitoring checks are scheduled to run daily at 12:00 p.m.
    
    [**Profiling checks**](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/data-profiling-checks.md) are designed to assess
    the initial data quality score of a data source. Profiling checks are also useful for exploring and experimenting with 
    various types of checks and determining the most suitable ones for regular data quality monitoring.
    
    [**Monitoring checks**](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/data-observability-monitoring-checks.md) are 
    standard checks that monitor the data quality of a table or column. They can also be referred to as **Data Observability** checks.
    These checks capture a single data quality result for the entire table or column.

## Add an Amazon Redshift connection using DQOps Shell

To add a connection run the following command in DQOps Shell.

```
dqo> connection add
```

Fill in the data you will be asked for.

```
Connection name (--name): connection1
Database provider type (--provider): 
 [ 1] bigquery
 [ 2] clickhouse
 [ 3] databricks
 [ 4] db2
 [ 5] duckdb
 [ 6] hana
 [ 7] mariadb
 [ 8] mysql
 [ 9] oracle
 [10] postgresql
 [11] presto
 [12] questdb
 [13] redshift
 [14] snowflake
 [15] spark
 [16] sqlserver
 [17] teradata
 [18] trino
Please enter one of the [] values: 13
Redshift host (--redshift-host)[${REDSHIFT_HOST}]: localhost
Redshift port (--redshift-port) [${REDSHIFT_PORT}]: 5439
Redshift database (--redshift-database) [${REDSHIFT_DATABASE}]: testing
Redshift user name (--redshift-username) [${REDSHIFT_USER}]: testing
Redshift password (--redshift-password) [${REDSHIFT_PASSWORD}]: xxx
Connection connecton1 was successfully added.
Run 'table import -c=connection1' to import tables.
```

You can also run the command with parameters to add a connection in just a single step.

```
dqo> connection add --name=connection1
--provider=redshift
--redshift-host=localhost
--redshift-port=5439
--redshift-database=testing
--redshift-user=testing
--redshift-password=xxx
```

After adding connection run `table import -c=connection1` to select schemas and import tables.

DQOps will ask you to select the schema from which the tables will be imported.

You can also add the schema and table name as parameters to import tables in just a single step.

```
dqo> table import --connection={connection name}
--schema={schema name}
--table={table name}
```

DQOps supports the use of the asterisk character * as a wildcard when selecting schemas and tables, which can substitute
any number of characters. For example, use  pub* to find all schema a name with a name starting with "pub". The *
character can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of the name.

## Connections configuration files

Connection configurations are stored in the YAML files in the `./sources` folder. The name of the connection is also
the name of the folder where the configuration file is stored.

Below is a sample YAML file showing an example configuration of the Redshift data source connection.

``` yaml
apiVersion: dqo/v1
kind: source
spec:
  provider_type: redshift
  redshift:
    host: redshift-cluster-2.cds5vq1bzgx5.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com
    port: 5439
    database: testing
    user: testing
    password: xxx
    properties:
      'connectTimeout': 15
  incident_grouping:
    grouping_level: table_dimension_category
    minimum_severity: warning
    max_incident_length_days: 60
    mute_for_days: 60
```

### **Reference of all connection parameters**
Complete documentation of all connection parameters used in the `spec.redshift` node is
described in the reference section of the [RedshiftParametersSpec](../reference/yaml/ConnectionYaml.md#redshiftparametersspec)
YAML file format.


## Configure the credentials

### Using shared credentials

With DQOps, you can configure credentials to access AWS S3 directly in the platform.

Please note, that any credentials and secrets shared with the DQOps Cloud or DQOps SaaS instances are stored in the .credentials folder.
This folder also contains the default credentials files pair for AWS named **AWS_default_config** and **AWS_default_credentials**.

``` { .asc .annotate hl_lines="4-5" }
$DQO_USER_HOME
├───...
└───.credentials                                                            
    ├───AWS_default_config
    ├───AWS_default_credentials
    └─...   
```

If you wish to use AWS authentication, the content of the files must be replaced with your aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key and region.
You can find more details on how to [manage access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in AWS documentation.

!!! warning

    If you do not replace the content of the files, the default credentials will be loaded from system.


To set the credential file in DQOps, follow these steps:

1. Open the Configuration in menu.
2. Select Shared credentials from the tree view on the left.
3. Click the edit link on the “AWS_default_credentials” file.

![Adding connection settings - environmental variables](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/credentials/aws-shared-credentials-ui.png)

4. In the text area, edit the aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key, replacing the placeholder text.

![Adding connection settings - environmental variables](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/credentials/edit-aws-shared-credential.png)

5. Click the **Save** button, to save changes, go back to the main **Shared credentials** view.

6. Edit the region in AWS_default_config file and save the file.


!!! tip "Use the system default credentials after filling in the shared credential"

    If you still want to use default credentials from AWS, 
    you must manually delete the .credentials/AWS_default_config and .credentials/AWS_default_credentials files from the DQOps credentials.


## Next steps

- We have provided a variety of use cases that use openly available datasets from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/datasets) to help you in using DQOps effectively. You can find the [complete list of use cases here](../examples/index.md).
- DQOps allows you to keep track of the issues that arise during data quality monitoring and send alert notifications directly to Slack. Learn more about [incidents](../working-with-dqo/managing-data-quality-incidents-with-dqops.md) and [notifications](../integrations/webhooks/index.md).
- The data in the table often comes from different data sources and vendors or is loaded by different data pipelines. Learn how [data grouping in DQOps](../working-with-dqo/set-up-data-grouping-for-data-quality-checks.md) can help you calculate separate data quality KPI scores for different groups of rows.
