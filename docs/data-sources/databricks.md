# How to activate data observability for Databricks
Read this guide to learn how to connect DQOps to Databricks from the UI, command-line interface, or directly in YAML files, and activate monitoring.

## Overview

Databricks is a unified, open analytics platform for building, deploying, 
sharing, and maintaining enterprise-grade data, analytics, and AI solutions at scale.

## Prerequisite credentials

To add Databricks data source connection to DQOps you need a Databricks SQL Warehouse instance.
It is also recommended to use an access token to connect an instance, so a permission to generate access token or a 
possession of a previously generated token is necessary.

!!! note "DQOps free version limits"

    Databricks drivers are not provided in an open-source version.

    For more details, please [contact DQOps sales](https://dqops.com/contact-us/).

[See the Databricks documentation for JDBC connection parameter references](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/jdbc/index.html).                        |
    
DQOps allows you to dynamically replace properties in connection settings with environment variables. To use it, simply
change "clear text" to ${ENV_VAR} using the drop-down menu at the end of the variable entry field and type your variable.

For example:

![Adding connection settings - environmental variables](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/connection-settings-envvar.jpg)

To add optional JDBC connection properties, just type the **JDBC connection property** and the **Value**. The value
can be in the ${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME} format to use dynamic substitution.

For example:

![Adding connection JDBC settings](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/connection-settings-JDBC-properties2.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

To remove the property, click the trash icon at the end of the input field.

After filling in the connection settings, click the **Test Connection** button to test the connection.

Click the **Save** connection button when the test is successful otherwise, you can check the details of what went wrong.


### **Import metadata using the user interface**

When you add a new connection, it will appear in the tree view on the left, and you will be redirected to the Import Metadata screen.
Now we can import schemas and tables.

1. Import the selected data resources (source schemas and tables) by clicking on the **Import Tables** button next to
   the name of the source schema from which you want to import tables.

    ![Importing schemas](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/importing-schemas.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

2. Select the tables you want to import or import all tables using the buttons in the upper right corner.

    ![Importing tables](https://dqops.com/docs/images/working-with-dqo/adding-connections/importing-tables.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

Upon import, you will receive information that a new tables have been imported. You can then begin collecting basic statistics
and profiling data by running default data profiling checks. Simply click on the **Start profiling** button to initiate this process.

![Collect basic statistics and profile data with default profiling checks](https://dqops.com/docs/images/getting-started/collect-basic-statistics-and-profile-data.png)

!!! info "Automatically activated checks"

    Once new tables are imported, DQOps automatically activates [profiling and monitoring checks](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/index.md).
    These checks include row count, table availability, and checks detecting schema changes. The profiling checks are scheduled 
    to run at 1:00 a.m. on the 1st day of every month, and the monitoring checks are scheduled to run daily at 12:00 p.m.
    
    [**Profiling checks**](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/data-profiling-checks.md) are designed to assess
    the initial data quality score of a data source. Profiling checks are also useful for exploring and experimenting with 
    various types of checks and determining the most suitable ones for regular data quality monitoring.
    
    [**Monitoring checks**](../dqo-concepts/definition-of-data-quality-checks/data-observability-monitoring-checks.md) are 
    standard checks that monitor the data quality of a table or column. They can also be referred to as **Data Observability** checks.
    These checks capture a single data quality result for the entire table or column.


## Add a Databricks connection using DQOps Shell

To add a connection run the following command in DQOps Shell.

```
dqo> connection add
```

Fill in the data you will be asked for.

```
Connection name (--name): connection1
Database provider type (--provider):
 [ 1] bigquery
 [ 2] databricks
 [ 3] mysql
 [ 4] oracle
 [ 5] postgresql
 [ 6] duckdb
 [ 7] presto
 [ 8] redshift
 [ 9] snowflake
 [10] spark
 [11] sqlserver
 [12] trino
Please enter one of the [] values: 2
Databricks host name (--databricks-host) [${DATABRICKS_HOST}]: <databricks_host>.azuredatabricks.net
Databricks port number (--databricks-port) [${DATABRICKS_PORT}]: 443
Databricks catalog name (--databricks-catalog) [${DATABRICKS_CATALOG}]: samples
Databricks http path (--databricks-http-path) [${DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH}]: /sql/1.0/warehouses/<warehouse_id>
Databricks access token (--databricks-access-token) [${DATABRICKS_ACCESS_TOKEN}]: <access_token>
Connection connection1 was successfully added.
Run 'table import -c=connection1' to import tables.
```

You can also run the command with parameters to add a connection in just a single step.

```
dqo> connection add --name=connection1
--provider=databricks
--databricks-host=<databricks_host>.azuredatabricks.net
--databricks-port=443
--databricks-catalog=samples
--databricks-http-path=/sql/1.0/warehouses/<warehouse_id>
--databricks-access-token=<access_token>
```

After adding connection run `table import -c=connection1` to select schemas and import tables.

DQOps will ask you to select the schema from which the tables will be imported.

You can also add the schema and table name as parameters to import tables in just a single step.

```
dqo> table import --connection={connection name}
--schema={schema name}
--table={table name}
```

DQOps supports the use of the asterisk character * as a wildcard when selecting schemas and tables, which can substitute
any number of characters. For example, use  pub* to find all schema a name with a name starting with "pub". The *
character can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of the name.

## Connections configuration files

Connection configurations are stored in the YAML files in the `./sources` folder. The name of the connection is also
the name of the folder where the configuration file is stored.

Below is a sample YAML file showing an example configuration of the Databricks data source connection.

``` yaml
apiVersion: dqo/v1
kind: source
spec:
  provider_type: databricks
  databricks:
    host: <databricks_host>.azuredatabricks.net
    catalog: samples
    http_path: /sql/1.0/warehouses/<warehouse_id>
    access_token: <access_token>
    database: samples
  incident_grouping:
    grouping_level: table_dimension_category
    minimum_severity: warning
    max_incident_length_days: 60
    mute_for_days: 60
```

### **Reference of all connection parameters**
Complete documentation of all connection parameters used in the `spec.databricks` node is
described in the reference section of the [DatabricksParametersSpec](../reference/yaml/ConnectionYaml.md#databricksparametersspec)
YAML file format.


## How to activate data observability for external tables using Databricks in Azure

This guide shows how to connect an external table using Databricks. The example will use the Azure Blob Storage for storing data.


### Environment

The components of the run environment includes:

- Databricks instance in Azure
- Storage account with data
- Local DQOps instance


### Connecting databricks to the storage account

To work on data stored at Azure Blob Storage, mounting the file system is required in Databricks.
The example uses SAS key for Databricks authorization to the Azure Blob Storage.

You can generate SAS token at the specific Azure container on the Containers list view of the Storage account in Azure Portal.

The mount configuration is created with use of Databricks notebook.
Also, the compute resource is required to execute notebooks.


The notebook script starts with the Spark configuration of the SAS key authorization.

```
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.auth.type.<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "SAS")
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.sas.token.provider.type.<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.sas.FixedSASTokenProvider")
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.sas.fixed.token.<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "<SAS_token>")
```

Replace **&lt;storage_account&gt;** and **&lt;SAS_token&gt;** accordingly.

For the testing purpose we use the shortest path of the configuration.
In the production environment any keys should be hidden.
You better use dbutils.secrets for storing and accessing the SAS token.


Then you can mount the resource.

```
dbutils.fs.mount(
    source="wasbs://<container_name>@<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net",
    mount_point="/mnt/<name_of_mount>",
    extra_configs={
        "fs.azure.sas.<container_name>.<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net": "<SAS_token>"
    }
)
```

Replace **&lt;container_name&gt;**, **&lt;storage_account&gt;** and **&lt;name_of_mount&gt;** accordingly.


To test the mount execute read function on a data file from storage.
The following lines read a parquet file as a data frame and prints the content of the file to the code editor.

```
df = spark.read.parquet("/mnt/<name_of_mount>/<the_rest_of_the_path>/<file_name>.parquet")
df.show()
```

You should see data in tabular format similar to this.

```
+----------+---------------+------------+
|id:INTEGER|date:LOCAL_DATE|value:STRING|
+----------+---------------+------------+
|         1|     2022-02-01|         abc|
|         2|     2022-02-02|         abc|
|         3|     2022-02-03|         abc|
```

For mounts verification you can also run the function:

```
display(dbutils.fs.ls("/mnt/<name_of_mount>"))
```


### Make external table available in SQL Editor

The data called by Databricks are external to it. This means Databricks will not load the data files to it's internal storage.
Rather it uses the SQL Warehouse to run queries and read the data only.

To achieve this Databricks need to know where the data are stored and know the metadata of the data source.

Before you execute any SQL query, select the **hive_metastore** catalog in Databricks and run the SQL Warehouse.

For the single parquet file both are accomplished by creating an external table in Databricks

```
CREATE TABLE my_external_table_parquet
USING PARQUET
OPTIONS (
    path "/mnt/<name_of_mount>/<the_rest_of_the_path>/<file_name>.parquet"
);
```

For the multiple parquet files under the hive style partitioning folder structure point the resource to the top folder with use of above command.
Then metadata have to be gathered with the list of available partitions.

```
MSCK REPAIR TABLE my_external_table_parquet;
```

Then partitions information become available. You can test it by listing them with the command:

```
SHOW PARTITIONS readouts
```

When using single file test data with simple SELECT statement.

```
SELECT <column_from_your_dataset>
FROM my_external_table_parquet;
```

### Connecting to Databricks with DQOps

For establishing the connection the following are needed:

- Databricks Host
- Databricks HttpPath
- Databricks Access Token
- Catalog name

Server hostname (Host) and HTTP path can be found under the SQL Warehouse's Connection Details.

Access token is available at your user settings in the menu bar in the top right corner, in Settings > Developer > Access tokens.
Create a new one or reuse a token.

Along with the Host, HttpPath and Access Token, fill the Connection name and the Catalog.
The Catalog should be filled with **hive_metastore** to access the catalog with external tables.


## Next steps

- We have provided a variety of use cases that use openly available datasets from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/datasets) to help you in using DQOps effectively. You can find the [complete list of use cases here](../examples/index.md).
- DQOps allows you to keep track of the issues that arise during data quality monitoring and send alert notifications directly to Slack. Learn more about [incidents](../working-with-dqo/managing-data-quality-incidents-with-dqops.md) and [notifications](../integrations/webhooks/index.md).
- The data in the table often comes from different data sources and vendors or is loaded by different data pipelines. Learn how [data grouping in DQOps](../working-with-dqo/set-up-data-grouping-for-data-quality-checks.md) can help you calculate separate data quality KPI scores for different groups of rows.
