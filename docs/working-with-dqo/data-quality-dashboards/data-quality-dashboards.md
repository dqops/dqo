# Review the results of data quality monitoring on dashboards

DQOps has multiple built-in data quality dashboards for displaying [data quality KPI](../../dqo-concepts/data-quality-kpis/data-quality-kpis.md).
Our dashboards use [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/overview) (formerly Google Data Studio) business
intelligence environment.

You can [learn more about different types of dashboards](../../dqo-concepts/data-quality-dashboards/data-quality-dashboards.md) in the Concept section.

## Prerequisite

To be able to display results on data quality dashboards, you need to have a DQOps account and synchronize locally stored results with it.  
To synchronize the data just click on the **Synchronize** button in the upper right corner of the navigation tab or run `cloud sync all` command in DQOps Shell.

You can read more about `cloud` command in [Command-line specification section](../../command-line-interface/cloud.md).

## View results on dashboards

To view dashboards, simply go to the **Data Quality Dashboard** section, and select the dashboard of interest from the tree view on the left.

For example, to review the summary KPIs of all run monitoring checks you can use the **KPIs scorecard - summary** dashboard.
You can find it in the **Monitoring** group, **Data quality KPIs** subgroup.
