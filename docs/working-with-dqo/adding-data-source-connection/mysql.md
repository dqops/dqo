# MySQL

MySQL is an open source, easy-to-use and flexible SQL database management system developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.
MySQL is generally faster and more efficient than other relational database management systems (RDBMS), so it is often the preferred
choice for applications that require high performance.

## Prerequisite credentials

You need a MySQL account. Use the TCP/IP Properties (IP Addresses Tab) dialog box to configure the TCP/IP protocol options for a specific IP address. In case of restrictions, you need to add the IP address used by DQO to [NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections Using Direct Connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-tcp-definition-direct.html).

## Adding MySQL connection using graphic interface

[JDBC Concepts.](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-usagenotes-basic.html).                                                                                                   |
    
    DQO allows you to dynamically replace properties in connection settings with environment variables. To use it, simply
    change "clear text" to ${ENV_VAR} using the drop-down menu at the end of the variable entry field and type your variable.

    For example:
    ![Adding connection settings - environmental variables](https://dqo.ai/docs/images/working-with-dqo/connection-settings-envvar.jpg)

    To add optional JDBC connection properties just type the **JDBC connection property** and the **Value**. The value
    can be in the ${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME} format to use dynamic substitution.

    For example:
    ![Adding connection JDBC settings](https://dqo.ai/docs/images/working-with-dqo/connection-settings-JDBC-properties.jpg)

    To remove the property click on the trash icon add the end of the input field.

4. After filling in the connection settings, click the **Test Connection** button to test the connection.
5. Click the **Save** connection button when the test is successful otherwise you can check the details of what went wrong.
6. Import the selected data resources (source schemas and tables) by clicking on the **Import Tables** button next to
   the name of the source schema from which you want to import tables.

    ![Adding connection](https://dqo.ai/docs/images/working-with-dqo/importing-schemas.jpg)

7. Select the tables you want to import or import all tables using the buttons in the upper right corner.

## Adding MySQL connection using DQO Shell

To add a connection run the following command in DQO Shell.
```
dqo.ai> connection add
```

Fill in the data you will be asked for.

```
Connection name (--name): connection1
Database provider type (--provider): 
[ 1] bigquery
[ 2] snowflake
[ 3] postgresql
[ 4] redshift
[ 5] sqlserver
[ 6] mysql
Please enter one of the [] values: 6
MySQL host (--mysql-host)[${MYSQL_HOST}]: localhost
MySQL port (--mysql-port) [${MYSQL_PORT}]: 3306
MySQL database(--mysql-database) [${MYSQL_DATABASE}]: testing
MySQL user name (--mysql-user) [${MYSQL_USER}]: test
MySQL password (--mysql-password) [${MYSQL_PASSWORD}]: xxx
Connection connecton1 was successfully added.
Run 'table import -c=connection1' to import tables.
```

You can also run the command with parameters to add a connection in just a single step.

```
dqo.ai> connection add --name=connection1
--provider=mysql
--mysql-host=localhost
--mysql-port=3306
--mysql-database=testing
--mysql-username=test
--mysql-password=xxx
```

After adding connection run `table import -c=connection1` to select schemas and import tables.

DQO will ask you to select the schema from which the tables will be imported.

You can also add the schema and table name as a parameter to import tables in just a single step.

```
dqo.ai> table import --connection={connection name}
--schema={schema name}
--table={table name}
```
DQO supports the use of the asterisk character * as a wildcard when selecting schemas and tables, which can substitute
any number of characters. For example, use  pub* to find all schema a name with a name starting with "pub". The *
character can be used at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the name.

## Connections configuration files

Connection configurations are stored in the YAML files in the `./sources` folder. The name of the connection is also
the name of the folder where the configuration file is stored.

Below is a sample YAML file showing an example configuration of the MySQL data source connection.

``` yaml
apiVersion: dqo/v1
kind: source
spec:
  provider_type: mysql
  mysql:
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    user: testing
    database: testing
    password: xxx
    ssl: true
    properties:
      cacheDefaultTimeZone: "false"
  incident_grouping:
    grouping_level: table_dimension_category
    minimum_severity: warning
    max_incident_length_days: 60
    mute_for_days: 60
```
