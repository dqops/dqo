## anomaly differencing percentile moving average
Data quality rule that verifies if a data quality sensor readout value is probable under
 the estimated normal distribution based on the increments of previous values gathered
 within a time window.

**Rule summary**

The anomaly differencing percentile moving average data quality rule is described below.

| Category | Full rule name | Rule specification source code | Python source code |
| ---------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| percentile | <span class="no-wrap-code">`percentile/anomaly_differencing_percentile_moving_average`</span> | [Rule configuration](https://github.com/dqops/dqo/blob/develop/home/rules/percentile/anomaly_differencing_percentile_moving_average.dqorule.yaml) | [Python code](https://github.com/dqops/dqo/blob/develop/home/rules/percentile/anomaly_differencing_percentile_moving_average.py) |


**Rule parameters**

The parameters passed to the rule are shown below.

| Field name | Description | Allowed data type | Required | Allowed values |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|<span class="no-wrap-code">`anomaly_percent`</span>|Probability that the current sensor readout will achieve values within the mean according to the distribution of the previous values gathered within the time window. In other words, the inter-quantile range around the mean of the estimated normal distribution. Set the time window at the threshold level for all severity levels (warning, error, fatal) at once. The default is a time window of 90 periods (days, etc.), but at least 30 readouts must exist to run the calculation.

 the estimated normal distribution based on the increments of previous values gathered
 within a time window.

## percentile moving 7 days
Data quality rule that verifies if a data quality sensor readout value is probable under
 the estimated normal distribution based on the previous values gathered within a time window.

**Rule summary**

The percentile moving 7 days data quality rule is described below.

| Category | Full rule name | Rule specification source code | Python source code |
| ---------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| percentile | <span class="no-wrap-code">`percentile/percentile_moving_7_days`</span> | [Rule configuration](https://github.com/dqops/dqo/blob/develop/home/rules/percentile/percentile_moving_7_days.dqorule.yaml) | [Python code](https://github.com/dqops/dqo/blob/develop/home/rules/percentile/percentile_moving_7_days.py) |


**Rule parameters**

The parameters passed to the rule are shown below.

| Field name | Description | Allowed data type | Required | Allowed values |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|<span class="no-wrap-code">`percentile_above`</span>|Probability that the current sensor readout will achieve values greater than it would be expected from the estimated distribution based on the previous values gathered within the time window. In other words, the upper quantile of the estimated normal distribution. Set the time window at the threshold level for all severity levels (warning, error, fatal) at once. The default is a 7 time periods (days, etc.) time window, but at least 3 readouts must exist to run the calculation.|*double*| ||
|<span class="no-wrap-code">`percentile_below`</span>|Probability that the current sensor readout will achieve values lesser than it would be expected from the estimated distribution based on the previous values gathered within the time window. In other words, the lower quantile of the estimated normal distribution. Set the time window at the threshold level for all severity levels (warning, error, fatal) at once.
