## between percent moving average 30 days
Data quality rule that verifies if a data quality sensor readout value is not above X percent of the moving average within a time window.

**Rule summary**

The between percent moving average 30 days data quality rule is described below.

| Category | Full rule name | Rule specification source code | Python source code |
| ---------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| averages | <span class="no-wrap-code">`averages/between_percent_moving_average_30_days`</span> | [Rule configuration](https://github.com/dqops/dqo/blob/develop/home/rules/averages/between_percent_moving_average_30_days.dqorule.yaml) | [Python code](https://github.com/dqops/dqo/blob/develop/home/rules/averages/between_percent_moving_average_30_days.py) |


**Rule parameters**

The parameters passed to the rule are shown below.

| Field name | Description | Allowed data type | Required | Allowed values |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|<span class="no-wrap-code">`max_percent_above`</span>|The maximum percentage (e.g., 3%) by which the current sensor readout can be above a moving average within the time window. Set the time window at the threshold level for all severity levels (low, medium, high) at once. The default is a 14 time periods (days, etc.) time window, but at least 7 readouts must exist to run the calculation.|*double*| ||
|<span class="no-wrap-code">`max_percent_below`</span>|The maximum percentage (e.g., 3%) by which the current sensor readout can be below a moving average within the time window. Set the time window at the threshold level for all severity levels (low, medium, high) at once.
