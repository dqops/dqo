# Detecting data quality issues with accuracy
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to accuracy.
The data quality checks are configured in the `accuracy` category in DQOps.

## Accuracy category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to accuracy are listed below.

## List of accuracy checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*total_row_count_match_percent*](../../checks/table/accuracy/total-row-count-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|A table-level check that compares the row count of the current (tested) table with the row count of another table that is referenced. This check ensures that the difference between the row counts is below the maximum accepted percentage of difference. This check runs an SQL query with an INNER JOIN clause to join another (referenced) table that must be defined in the same database.|:material-check-bold:|


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/accuracy](../../checks/table/accuracy/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.

## List of accuracy checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*total_sum_match_percent*](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-sum-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|A column-level check that ensures that the difference between the sum of all values in the tested column and the sum of values in another column in a referenced table is below a maximum accepted percentage of difference. This check runs an SQL query with an INNER JOIN clause to join another (referenced) table that must be defined in the same database.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*total_min_match_percent*](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-min-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|A column-level check that ensures that the difference between the minimum value in the tested column and the minimum value in another column in a referenced table is below a maximum accepted percentage of difference. This check runs an SQL query with an INNER JOIN clause to join another (referenced) table that must be defined in the same database.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*total_max_match_percent*](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-max-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|A column-level check that ensures that the difference between the maximum value in the tested column and the maximum value in another column in a referenced table is below a maximum accepted percentage of difference. This check runs an SQL query with an INNER JOIN clause to join another (referenced) table that must be defined in the same database.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*total_average_match_percent*](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-average-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|A column-level check that ensures that the difference between the average value in the tested column and the average value of another column in the referenced table is below the maximum accepted percentage of difference. This check runs an SQL query with an INNER JOIN clause to join another (referenced) table that must be defined in the same database.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*total_not_null_count_match_percent*](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-not-null-count-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|A column-level check that ensures that the difference between the count of null values in the tested column and the count of null values in another column in a referenced table is below a maximum accepted percentage of difference. This check runs an SQL query with an INNER JOIN clause to join another (referenced) table that must be defined in the same database.|:material-check-bold:|
