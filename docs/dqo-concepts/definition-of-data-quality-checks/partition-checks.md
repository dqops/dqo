# Partitioned data quality checks
Read this guide to understand how data quality checks in DQOps are applied to analyzing partitioned data, or time-based data such as financial records.

## What are partition checks?
The partition(ed) checks in DQOps are responsible for monitoring data quality for date partitioned data, or to 
detect data quality issues in append-only tables.

The **partitioned** data quality checks run SQL queries on monitored tables adding a `GROUP BY TRUNCATE(<timestamp_column>)` clause,
capturing results for every daily or monthly partition.
The [data quality results](../data-storage-of-data-quality-results.md) generated by *partitioned* checks are stored
for every date or month **of data**.

Capturing data quality results for time periods is important for:

- storing an audit log of executed data quality checks for partitions,
- analyzing financial data, when only the most recent data for the current or previous month is important, and
  older financial records are read-only (closed),
- measuring very big tables, even at terabyte and petabyte scale with [incremental data quality monitoring](../incremental-data-quality-monitoring.md),
- measuring [data quality KPIs](../definition-of-data-quality-kpis.md) at a partition level,
- detecting data quality issues early when the issue affected only the most recently loaded data, 
  but only <1% or 0.1% of rows is affected (one day out of 3 years of data).

Before activating a data quality [**partitioned**](partition-checks.md) check, you should test
a [**profiling**](data-profiling-checks.md) version of the data quality check. Every [**monitoring**](data-observability-monitoring-checks.md) and
[**partition**](partition-checks.md) data quality check has a **profiling** version, named as _profiling\_\*_.

!!! tip "Tables do not need to be physically partitioned by date to benefit from partitioned checks"

    DQOps does not require that tables are physically time-partitioned. You can use **partitioned** checks to analyze any
    table that has a timestamp column, such as: *transaction timestamp*, *event timestamp*, *created at* timestamp, *impression timestamp*.



### **Time scale**
Partitioned checks are divided into two groups, having almost the same data quality checks.

- **Daily partitioned** checks track the data quality status for **each day**
- **Monthly partitioned** checks track the data quality status for **each month**, but are not supporting *anomaly detection* checks
  because one data quality result per month is not enough to use prediction. These checks are available in the paid versions of DQOps.

### **Summary**
The following table summarizes the key concepts of *partitioned* data quality checks in DQOps,
divided by **daily partitioned** and **monthly partitioned** checks.

| Check type         | Time scale | Purpose                                                                                                                                                     | Time period truncation                                                                                                                                                                               | Check name prefix        |
|--------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **_partitioned_**  | *daily*    | *Daily partitioned* checks store the data quality status for **each day of data**, analyzing daily partitions or any table in **daily** time periods.       | One data quality monitoring result captured **per daily** partition.<br/>When a *daily* partitioned check is run again any time, the previous result for that daily `time_period` is replaced.       | _daily\_partition\_\*_   |
| **_partitioned_**  | *monthly*  | *Daily partitioned* checks store the data quality status for **each month of data**, analyzing monthly partitions or any table in **monthly** time periods. | One data quality monitoring result captured **per monthly** partition.<br/>When a *monthly* partitioned check is run again any time, the previous result for that monthly `time_period` is replaced. | _monthly\_partition\_\*_ |


## SQL queries for partitioned checks
The following example shows an SQL query generated by DQOps to run the
[daily_partition_nulls_percent](../../checks/column/nulls/nulls-percent.md#daily-partition-nulls-percent) check
that groups rows by the date column, aggregating (truncating) the data quality measures by date, without the time.

``` { .sql .annotate linenums="1" hl_lines="11-12" }
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 100.0
        ELSE 100.0 * SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN analyzed_table."target_column" IS NULL THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) / COUNT(*)
    END AS actual_value,
    CAST(analyzed_table."transaction_date" AS date) AS time_period,
    CAST((CAST(analyzed_table."date_column" AS date)) AS TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) AS time_period_utc
FROM "your_postgresql_database"."<target_schema>"."<target_table>" AS analyzed_table
GROUP BY time_period, time_period_utc
ORDER BY time_period, time_period_utc
```

The date column used for grouping by a time period in the example above is the `"transaction_date"`.
The column name must be configured, which is described in the [setting up date partitioning column](#setting-up-date-partitioning-column) later.


## Partitioned checks in DQOps user interface
### **Daily partitioning**
Daily partitioned checks truncate the column used for partitioning to the beginning of the day.
The following example uses a sample table with a history of 911 service requests, the data is partitioned by the `created_date` column.

A [daily_partition_row_count](../../checks/table/volume/row-count.md#daily-partition-row-count) check was run for the last 7 daily partitions,
using an [**error** severity](index.md#error) rule that raises a data quality issue when the number of rows in a daily partition is below **600** rows.

The issue was detected on *September 29th, 2024*. The results are highlighted with an orange color for **error** severity issues. 

![Daily partitioned data quality check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/concepts/types-of-data-quality-checks/daily-partitioned-checks-editor-results-2.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

A longer history of partition volume (row counts) is shown when switching the view to a chart mode. 
The orange area limited from the top at **600** rows is the *error* severity threshold. Any data quality results for
daily partition below **600** rows are data quality issues when the volume of the partition for that day was below a minimum required size.

### **Monthly partitioned checks**
Monthly partitioned checks truncate the column used for partitioning to the beginning of the month.

A [monthly_partition_row_count](../../checks/table/volume/row-count.md#monthly-partition-row-count) check was run for the last 4 monthly partitions,
using an [**error** severity](index.md#error) rule that raises a data quality issue when the number of rows in a month is below **20000** rows.

The row counts for July, August and September 2024 met the volume requirement. The monthly data quality check
was run at *2024-10-07 15:26:16* (shown as the *Executed At* timestamp). Not all data for the current month (October 2024) were received yet,
and the table had only **4235** rows. An **error** severity issue was raised, because the minimum accepted monthly row count is **20000** rows.

![Monthly partitioned data quality check results](https://dqops.com/docs/images/concepts/types-of-data-quality-checks/monthly-partitioned-checks-editor-results2.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

Monthly monitoring checks are an advanced feature of DQOps available in the paid versions of DQOps.
Please contact [DQOps sales](https://dqops.com/contact-us/) for more information.

!!! warning "Using monthly partitioned checks to analyze the current month"

    The example above shows a challenge with analyzing partitioned data for the current month (monthly partitioned data),
    and for **today** (by **daily** partitioned checks). Some data quality checks may fail during the month, because not
    all data for that time period was received yet.

    The configuration parameter to enable analyzing also **today's** data or the data for the **current month** is shown
    in the next section [setting up date paritioning column](#setting-up-date-paritioning-column).


## Setting up date partitioning column
To run partition checks you need to configure a date or datetime columns which will be used as the time partitioning key for the table.
DQOps will use this column in the `GROUP BY` clause, truncating the date to the beginning of the day (**daily** partitioned checks)
or the 1st day of the month (**monthly** partitioned checks).

### **Configure partitioning column in the user interface**
When you navigate to the **Partition checks** section and choose a table or column that has not been configured with a date
partitioning column, a red warning message will appear above the Check editor saying **Partition checks will not be run, please configure the date or
datetime column**. Furthermore, this column will be highlighted in orange in the tree view on the left side of the screen.

![Not configured date partitioning column warning](https://dqops.com/docs/images/concepts/types-of-data-quality-checks/not-configured-date-partitioning-column-warning3.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }

To enable the time partition check, set a column that contains the date, datetime, or timestamp.

1. Go to the **Data Sources** section.
2. Select the table of interest from the tree view.
3. Select the **Data and time columns** tab and in the **Partition checks** section, select a column from the drop-down list in the "Date or datetime column
   name used for date/time partitioning used in partition checks" input field.

    You can also get to this screen by clicking the **Configure the date partitioning column** button located on the screen with a list of partition checks.

    ![Partitioning column configuration](https://dqops.com/docs/images/concepts/types-of-data-quality-checks/date-or-datetime-column-configuration-for-partion-checks3.png){ loading=lazy; width="1200px" }
    
4. Click the **Save** button in the upper right corner.
5. Click on the **Partition Checks** section at the top of the screen, to return to the partitioned checks section.

### **Configure partitioning column in the YAML file**
The date or datetime column for partition checks can be also configured by adding
the appropriate parameters to the YAML configuration file.

Below is an example of the YAML file showing a sample configuration with set datetime column `event_timestamp` for partition
checks `partition_by_column`.

``` yaml hl_lines="10"
apiVersion: dqo/v1
kind: table
spec:
  target:
    schema_name: target_schema
    table_name: target_table
  timestamp_columns:
    event_timestamp_column: 
    ingestion_timestamp_column: 
    partition_by_column: event_timestamp
```

## Difference between partitioned and monitoring checks
The difference between  [**partitioned**](partition-checks.md) check and [**monitoring**](data-observability-monitoring-checks.md)
is compared in the table below.

| Check type      | Range of rows for data quality issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Data quality result storage                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **monitoring**  | Monitoring checks **analyze the whole table**. An update to the oldest record in the table can trigger a data quality issue.                                                                                                                                                                    | Stores one result per **day** or **month** when the data quality check was run, adding a new result in the next day or in the next month.                                                               |
| **partitioned** | Partitioned checks use a `GROUP BY time_period` clause in SQL queries, **analyzing rows for each day or month separately**. A change such as null values in an old partition caused by reloading a partition with corrupted data generates a data quality issue with a time period in the past. | Stores one result for each **daily** or **monthly** partition, replacing data quality results when a **partitioned** check is run again with different rules, or the data in the partition has changed. |


## Partitioned checks pros and cons

### **When to use partitioned checks**
Use the partitioned checks to:

- Track and checkpoint the data quality for daily partitioned data, capturing separate data quality metrics and results for each partition

- Analyze append-only tables, such as **fact tables** in data warehouses

- Analyze financial data that should not change, when the month or year is closed

- Analyze **very big tables incrementally**, scanning only the most recent partitions, and avoiding additional pressure
  on the data source from a data quality platform

- Detect data quality issues early using [incremental data quality monitoring](../incremental-data-quality-monitoring.md)

- Analyze the quality of data in the **landing zone**, especially when the landing tables use automatic time partitioning and partition expiration managed
  by the database engine.


### **Limitations of partitioned checks**
The results of *partitioned* data quality checks are used to evaluate the data quality KPI and compliance with *data contracts* at a partition level.

- Do not use *partitioned* checks for the first time before experimenting with a [*profiling*](data-profiling-checks.md) variant of that check.
  The configuration of accepted *profiling* checks can be easily converted to *partitioned* checks. If a misconfigured *partitioned* check
  is run and fails, raising a data quality issues,
  the issues will decrease the [data quality KPI score](../definition-of-data-quality-kpis.md). You will have to use the
  [delete data quality results](../../working-with-dqo/delete-data-quality-results.md) screens to remove these data quality results.

- *Monthly partitioned* checks do not support [anomaly detection data quality checks](../../categories-of-data-quality-checks/how-to-detect-anomaly-data-quality-issues.md),
  because when only one data quality result for each data quality check is stored **per month**, there is not enough historical data
  to use prediction.

- Do not analyze decommissioned tables that were not updated for more than 3 months, even if they are date or time partitioned physically.
  The [data quality check editor](../dqops-user-interface-overview.md#check-editor) in DQOps is designed to show the results for the last 3 months,
  plus the current month. The data quality results for older partitions will not be shown.


## Partition check configuration in DQOps YAML files
The configuration of active data quality partition checks is stored in the [.dqotable.yaml](../configuring-table-metadata.md#table-yaml-file-structure)
files.
Please review the samples in the [configuring table metadata](../configuring-table-metadata.md) article to learn more.
