# Data quality monitoring checks for data observability
This guide shows how the data quality monitoring checks in DQOps are observing the data sources, and tracking the data quality with data quality KPIs.

## What are data monitoring checks?
The monitoring checks in DQOps are responsible for continuous monitoring the data quality of data sources.
The [data quality results](../data-storage-of-data-quality-results.md) generated by *monitoring* checks capture 
an end-of-day or an end-of-month data quality status of monitored data. 

Capturing an end-of-day (or end-of-month) status of the last execution of a data quality check is important for:

- storing an audit log of executed data quality checks, especially when auditing is required for regulatory reasons
- measuring [data quality KPIs](../definition-of-data-quality-kpis.md) to prove the trustfulness of data sources
- tracking the data quality improvement day-by-day, and presenting the progress of data cleansing projects
  to stakeholders and business sponsors of the data quality initiative 

Before activating a data quality  [**monitoring**](data-observability-monitoring-checks.md) check, you should test
a [**profiling**](data-profiling-checks.md) version of the data quality check. Every [**monitoring**](data-observability-monitoring-checks.md) and
[**partition**](partition-checks.md) data quality check has a **profiling** version, named as _profiling\_\*_.

### **Time scale**
Monitoring checks are divided into two groups, having almost the same data quality checks.

- **daily monitoring** checks track the end-of-day data quality status
- **monthly monitoring** checks track the end-of-month data quality status, but are not supporting *anomaly detection* checks
  because one data quality result per month is not enough to use prediction

### **Summary**
The following table summarizes the key concepts of *monitoring* data quality checks in DQOps,
divided by **daily monitoring** and **monthly monitoring** checks.

| Check type       | Time scale | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Time period truncation                                                                                                                                                | Check name prefix |

## Monitoring checks in DQOps user interface

### **Daily monitoring checks**
The following screen shows the data quality results of the [daily_row_count](../../checks/table/volume/row-count.md#daily-row-count)
data quality check that measures the number of rows in a table using a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <monitored_table>` SQL query.

The data quality check **error** severity rule has a parameter `min_count: 1`, which would raise an *error* severity issue if the table is empty.
The other threshold of the **warning** severity rule verifies if the table has at least 500.000 rows, raising a *warning* severity issue when the table
is smaller.
The data quality check details panel on the [check editor](../dqops-user-interface-overview.md#check-editor) shows that all recent
data quality check runs failed with a *warning* severity issue, because the table had less than 500.000 rows for the last 11 days
when the data quality check was run. The highest detected row count was 488.478 rows.

The *Executed At* column shows the time when the data quality check was run, and the *Checkpoint date* column shows the value
of the *time_period* value from the [check_results](../../reference/parquetfiles/check_results.md) Parquet table used by DQOps
to store the data quality results.

Because *daily monitoring* checks store the end-of-day status (and only one result per check and day of running),
the values of the *Checkpoint date* (`time_period` parquet column) are truncated to the beginning of the day when the check was run.

The same data quality results are also shown on the chart view.
All captured data quality metrics are presented as an `Actual value` time series on the chart, called the [*data quality sensor readouts*](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md) in DQOps.
Because all recent row counts were below the minimum required 500.000 rows,
all the results are shown within the yellow zone for *warning* severity data quality issues.

### **Monthly monitoring checks**
The *monthly monitoring* checks store the end-of-month data quality status, replacing previously captured results. 
The following screen shows the result of running the [monthly_row_count](../../checks/table/volume/row-count.md#monthly-row-count)
at *2020-01-20 16:56:17* (January 20th, 2024). 

DQOps stored one result for January 2024, truncating the value of the *Checkpoint date* (`time_period` parquet column) to the beginning of the month.

## Monitoring checks pros and cons

### **When to use monitoring checks**
Use the data monitoring checks to:

 - Track and checkpoint the end-of-day (or end-of-month) data quality status for every data source.

 - Measure the improvement of the data quality score using [data quality KPIs](../definition-of-data-quality-kpis.md).

 - Schedule data quality check using a [DQOps CRON scheduler](../../working-with-dqo/configure-scheduling-of-data-quality-checks/index.md).

 - Run data quality checks from data pipelines, starting the [run_checks](../../client/operations/jobs.md#run_checks)
   using the [DQOps REST API Client](../../client/index.md), or
   [starting data quality checks from shell](../command-line-interface.md#integrating-dqops-into-shell-scripts).

 - Track the progress of data cleansing projects, measuring the [data quality KPI](../definition-of-data-quality-kpis.md) 
   as a percentage of passed *daily quality checks*. The data quality KPI can be calculated for each [data quality dimension](../data-quality-dimensions.md),
   and for all data sources, tables, [categories of data quality checks](../../categories-of-data-quality-checks/index.md).

![history of data quality KPI per day an data quality dimension](https://dqops.com/docs/images/concepts/types-of-data-quality-checks/data-quality-kpi-history-current-month-chart-min.png)

!!! tip "You can run monitoring checks multiple times during the day"

    It is safe to run *monitoring* checks every time when new data is loaded into a monitored table, even multiple times during the day.
    DQOps will replace the last known data quality result during the day or month in respectively *daily monitoring* checks and *monthly monitoring* checks. 


### **Limitations of monitoring checks**
The results of *monitoring* data quality checks are used to evaluate the data quality KPI and compliance with *data contracts*.

- Do not use *monitoring* checks for the first time before experimenting with a [*profiling*](data-profiling-checks.md) variant of that check.
  The configuration of accepted *profiling* checks can be easily converted to *monitoring* checks. If a misconfigured *monitoring* check
  is run and fails, raising a data quality issues,
  the issues will decrease the [data quality KPI score](../definition-of-data-quality-kpis.md). You will have to use the 
  [delete data quality results](../../working-with-dqo/delete-data-quality-results.md) screens to remove these data quality results.

- **Monthly monitoring** checks do not support [anomaly detection data quality checks](../../categories-of-data-quality-checks/how-to-detect-anomaly-data-quality-issues.md),
  because when only one data quality result for each data quality check is stored **per month**, there is not enough historical data 
  to use prediction.


## Monitoring check configuration in DQOps YAML files
The configuration of active data quality monitoring checks is stored in the [.dqotable.yaml](../configuring-table-metadata.md#table-yaml-file-structure)
files.
Please review the samples in the [configuring table metadata](../configuring-table-metadata.md) article to learn more.
