# Detecting data quality issues with timeliness
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to timeliness.
The data quality checks are configured in the `timeliness` category in DQOps.

## timeliness category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to timeliness are listed below.

## List of timeliness checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[data_freshness](../../checks/table/timeliness/data-freshness.md)|Timeliness|Table-level check that calculates the time difference between the most recent row in the table and the current time. The timestamp column that is used for comparison is defined as the timestamp_columns.event_timestamp_column on the table configuration. This check is also known as &quot;Data Freshness&quot;.|:material-check-bold:|
|[data_staleness](../../checks/table/timeliness/data-staleness.md)|Timeliness|Table-level check that calculates the time difference between the last timestamp when any data was loaded into a table and the current time. This check could be used only when the data pipeline, a ETL process or a trigger in the data warehouse is filling an extra column with the timestamp when the data loading job was loaded. The ingestion column that is used for comparison is defined as the timestamp_columns.ingestion_timestamp_column on the table configuration. This check is also known as &quot;Data Staleness&quot;.| |
|[data_ingestion_delay](../../checks/table/timeliness/data-ingestion-delay.md)|Timeliness|Table-level check that calculates time difference between the most recent row in the table and the most recent timestamp when the last row was loaded into the data warehouse / data lake. The most recent row is identified by finding the most recent (maximum) value of the timestamp column that should contain the last modification timestamp from the source. The timestamp when the row was loaded is identified by the most recent (maximum) value a timestamp column that was filled by the data pipeline, for example: &quot;loaded_at&quot;, &quot;updated_at&quot;, etc. This check requires that the data pipeline is filling an extra column with the timestamp when the data loading job has been executed. The names of both columns used for comparison should be specified in the &quot;timestamp_columns&quot; configuration entry on the table.| |
|[reload_lag](../../checks/table/timeliness/reload-lag.md)|Timeliness|Table-level check that calculates maximum difference in days between ingestion timestamp and event timestamp rows. This check should be executed only as a partitioned check because this check finds the longest delay between the time that the row was created in the data source and the timestamp when the row was loaded into its daily or monthly partition. This check will detect that a daily or monthly partition was reloaded, setting also the most recent timestamps in the created_at, loaded_at, inserted_at or other similar columns filled by the data pipeline or an ETL process during data loading.| |
