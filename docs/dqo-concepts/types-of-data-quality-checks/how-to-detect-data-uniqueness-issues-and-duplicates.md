# Detecting data quality issues with uniqueness
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to uniqueness.
The data quality checks are configured in the `uniqueness` category in DQOps.

## uniqueness category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to uniqueness are listed below.

**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [column/uniqueness](../../checks/column/uniqueness/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
