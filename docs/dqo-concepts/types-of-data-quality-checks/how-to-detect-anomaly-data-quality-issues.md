# Detecting data quality issues with anomaly
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to anomaly.
The data quality checks are configured in the `anomaly` category in DQOps.

## anomaly category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to anomaly are listed below.

| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[mean_anomaly](../../checks/column/anomaly/mean-anomaly.md)|Consistency|Column level check that ensures that the mean value in a monitored column is within a two-tailed percentile from measurements made during the last 90 days.| |

**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [column/anomaly](../../checks/column/anomaly/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
