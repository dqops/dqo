# Detecting data quality issues with bool
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to bool.
The data quality checks are configured in the `bool` category in DQOps.

## Bool category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to bool are listed below.

## Detecting bool issues
How to detect bool data quality issues.

## Use case
| **Name of the example**                                                                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |

| [Percentage of false boolean values](../../examples/data-reasonability/percentage-of-false-values.md) | This example shows how to detect that the percentage of false values remains above a set threshold using [false_percent](../../checks/column/bool/false-percent.md) check. |

**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [column/bool](../../checks/column/bool/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
