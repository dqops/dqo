# Detecting data quality issues with schema
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to schema.
The data quality checks are configured in the `schema` category in DQOps.

## Schema category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to schema are listed below.

| [Detect table schema changes](../../examples/schema/detect-table-schema-changes.md) | This example shows how to detect schema changes on the table using several schema detection checks. |


## List of schema checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*column_count*](../../checks/table/schema/column-count.md)|Completeness|Table-level check that retrieves the metadata of the monitored table from the data source, counts the number of columns and compares it to an expected number of columns.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*column_count_changed*](../../checks/table/schema/column-count-changed.md)|Consistency|A table-level check that detects if the number of columns in the table has changed since the last time the check (checkpoint) was run. This check retrieves the metadata of the monitored table from the data source, counts the number of columns and compares it to the last known number of columns that was captured and is stored in the data quality check results database.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*column_list_changed*](../../checks/table/schema/column-list-changed.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that detects if the list of columns has changed since the last time the check was run. This check will retrieve the metadata of a tested table and calculate a hash of the column names. The hash will not depend on the order of columns, only on the column names. A data quality issue will be detected if new columns were added or columns that existed during the previous test were dropped.| |
|[*column_list_or_order_changed*](../../checks/table/schema/column-list-or-order-changed.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that detects if the list of columns and the order of columns have changed since the last time the check was run. This check will retrieve the metadata of a tested table and calculate a hash of the column names. The hash will depend on the order of columns. A data quality issue will be detected if new columns were added, columns that existed during the previous test were dropped or the columns were reordered.| |
|[*column_types_changed*](../../checks/table/schema/column-types-changed.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that detects if the column names or column types have changed since the last time the check was run. This check calculates a hash of the column names and all the components of the column&#x27;s data type: the data type name, length, scale, precision and nullability. A data quality issue will be detected if the hash of the column data types has changed. This check does not depend on the order of columns, the columns could be reordered as long as all columns are still present and the data types match since the last time they were tested.| |


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/schema](../../checks/table/schema/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.

## List of schema checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[*column_exists*](../../checks/column/schema/column-exists.md)|Completeness|Column level check that reads the metadata of the monitored table and verifies that the column still exists in the data source. The data quality sensor returns 1.0 when the column was found or 0.0 when the column was not found.|:material-check-bold:|
|[*column_type_changed*](../../checks/column/schema/column-type-changed.md)|Consistency|Column level check that detects if the data type of the column has changed since the last time it was retrieved. This check calculates a hash of all the components of the column&#x27;s data type: the data type name, length, scale, precision and nullability. A data quality issue will be detected if the hash of the column&#x27;s data types has changed.|:material-check-bold:|
