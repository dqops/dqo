# Detecting data quality issues with accuracy
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to accuracy.
The data quality checks are configured in the `accuracy` category in DQOps.

## accuracy category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to accuracy are listed below.

How to detect accuracy data quality issues.

## List of accuracy checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[total_row_count_match_percent](../../checks/table/accuracy/total-row-count-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|Table-level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum percentage of difference of row count of a tested table and of an row count of another (reference) table.|:material-check-bold:|


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/accuracy](../../checks/table/accuracy/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.

## List of accuracy checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[total_sum_match_percent](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-sum-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|Column-level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum percentage of difference of sum of a table column and of a sum of another table column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[total_min_match_percent](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-min-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|Column level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum percentage of difference of min of a table column and of a min of another table column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[total_max_match_percent](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-max-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|Column level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum percentage of difference of max of a table column and of a max of another table column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[total_average_match_percent](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-average-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|Column level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum percentage of difference of average of a table column and of an average of another table column.|:material-check-bold:|
|[total_not_null_count_match_percent](../../checks/column/accuracy/total-not-null-count-match-percent.md)|Accuracy|Column level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum percentage of difference of the row count of a tested table&#x27;s column (counting the not null values) and of an row count of another (reference) table, also counting all rows with not null values.|:material-check-bold:|
