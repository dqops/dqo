## Use cases

| [Detect table availability issues](../../examples/data-availability/detect-table-availability-issues.md) | This example shows how to verify that a query can be executed on a table and that the server does not return errors using [table_availability](../../checks/table/availability/table-availability.md) check. |

## List of availability checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[table_availability](../../checks/table/availability/table-availability.md)|Availability|Table-level check that verifies that a query can be executed on a table and that the server does not return errors, that the table exists, and that the table is accessible (queryable). The actual value (the result of the check) is the number of failures. When the table is accessible and a simple query was executed without errors, the result is 0.0. The sensor result (the actual value) 1.0 means that there is a failure. A value higher than 1.0 is stored only in the check result table and it is the number of consecutive failures in following days.|:material-check-bold:|
