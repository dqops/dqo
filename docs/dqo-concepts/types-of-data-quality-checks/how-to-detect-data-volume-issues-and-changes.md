# Detecting data quality issues with volume
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to volume.
The data quality checks are configured in the `volume` category in DQOps.

## volume category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to volume are listed below.

## List of volume checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[row_count](../../checks/table/volume/row-count.md)|Completeness|Row count (select count(*) from ...) test that runs a row_count check, obtains a count of rows and verifies the number by calling the row count rule. The default configuration for all severity rules (warning, error, fatal data quality issue) is to require at least one row, which checks if the table is not empty.|:material-check-bold:|
|[row_count_anomaly](../../checks/table/volume/row-count-anomaly.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that ensures that the row count is within a two-tailed percentile from measurements made during the last 90 days.| |
|[row_count_change](../../checks/table/volume/row-count-change.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout.| |
|[row_count_change_1_day](../../checks/table/volume/row-count-change-1-day.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from yesterday.| |
|[row_count_change_7_days](../../checks/table/volume/row-count-change-7-days.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from last week.| |
|[row_count_change_30_days](../../checks/table/volume/row-count-change-30-days.md)|Consistency|Table-level check that ensures that the row count changed by a fixed rate since the last readout from last month.| |


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/volume](../../checks/table/volume/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
