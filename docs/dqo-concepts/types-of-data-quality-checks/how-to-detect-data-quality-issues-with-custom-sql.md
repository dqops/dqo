# Detecting data quality issues with custom sql
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to custom sql.
The data quality checks are configured in the `custom_sql` category in DQOps.

## custom sql category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to custom sql are listed below.

## List of custom sql checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[sql_condition_passed_percent_on_table](../../checks/table/custom_sql/sql-condition-passed-percent-on-table.md)|Validity|Table-level check that ensures that a minimum percentage of rows passed a custom SQL condition (expression).| |
|[sql_condition_failed_on_table](../../checks/table/custom_sql/sql-condition-failed-on-table.md)|Validity|Table level check that uses a custom SQL expression on each row to verify (assert) that all rows pass a custom condition defined as an SQL condition. Use the {alias} token to reference the tested table. This data quality check can be used to compare columns on the same table. For example, the condition can verify that the value in the *col_price* column is higher than the *col_tax* column using an SQL expression: &#x60;{alias}.col_price &gt; {alias}.col_tax&#x60;. Use an SQL expression that returns a *true* value for valid values and *false* for invalid values, because it is an assertion.|:material-check-bold:|
|[sql_aggregate_expression_on_table](../../checks/table/custom_sql/sql-aggregate-expression-on-table.md)|Reasonableness|Table-level check that calculates a given SQL aggregate expression and compares it with a maximum accepted value.| |


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/custom_sql](../../checks/table/custom_sql/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.

## List of custom sql checks at a column level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[sql_condition_failed_on_column](../../checks/column/custom_sql/sql-condition-failed-on-column.md)|Validity|Column level check that uses a custom SQL expression on each column to verify (assert) that all rows pass a custom condition defined as an SQL expression. Use the {alias} token to reference the tested table, and the {column} to reference the column that is tested. This data quality check can be used to compare columns on the same table. For example, when this check is applied on a *col_price* column, the condition can verify that the *col_price* is higher than the *col_tax* using an SQL expression: &#x60;{alias}.{column} &gt; {alias}.col_tax&#x60; Use an SQL expression that returns a *true* value for valid values and *false* for invalid values, because it is an assertion.|:material-check-bold:|
|[sql_condition_passed_percent_on_column](../../checks/column/custom_sql/sql-condition-passed-percent-on-column.md)|Validity|Column level check that ensures that a set percentage of rows passed a custom SQL condition (expression).| |
