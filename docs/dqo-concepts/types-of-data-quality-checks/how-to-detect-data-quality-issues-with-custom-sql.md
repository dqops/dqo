# Detecting data quality issues with custom sql
Read this guide to learn what types of data quality checks are supported in DQOps to detect issues related to custom sql.
The data quality checks are configured in the `custom_sql` category in DQOps.

## custom sql category
Data quality checks that are detecting issues related to custom sql are listed below.

## List of custom sql checks at a table level
| Data quality check name | Data quality dimension | Description | Standard check |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|[sql_condition_passed_percent_on_table](../../checks/table/custom_sql/sql-condition-passed-percent-on-table.md)|Validity|Table-level check that ensures that a minimum percentage of rows passed a custom SQL condition (expression).| |
|[sql_condition_failed_count_on_table](../../checks/table/custom_sql/sql-condition-failed-count-on-table.md)|Validity|Table-level check that ensures that there are no more than a maximum number of rows fail a custom SQL condition (expression).|:material-check-bold:|
|[sql_aggregate_expression_on_table](../../checks/table/custom_sql/sql-aggregate-expression-on-table.md)|Reasonableness|Table-level check that calculates a given SQL aggregate expression and compares it with a maximum accepted value.| |


**Reference and samples**

The full list of all data quality checks in this category is located in the [table/custom_sql](../../checks/table/custom_sql/index.md) reference.
The reference section provides YAML code samples that are ready to copy-paste to the [*.dqotable.yaml*](../../reference/yaml/TableYaml.md) files,
the parameters reference, and samples of data source specific SQL queries generated by [data quality sensors](../definition-of-data-quality-sensors.md)
that are used by those checks.
