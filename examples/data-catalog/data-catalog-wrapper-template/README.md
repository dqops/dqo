# Sample Data Catalog wrapper

This example is a simple Flask REST API application that receives notifications from DQOps about changes
of the data quality health status of tables.

You can use this example to extend it and use the API provided by the vendor of your Data Catalog to synchronize
data quality KPI scores in real time to your Data Catalog.

Please contact DQOps sales (https://dqops.com/contact-us/) about support of your Data Catalog platform.
