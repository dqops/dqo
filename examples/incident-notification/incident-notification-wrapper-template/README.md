# Sample Incident Notification wrapper

This example is a simple Flask REST API application that receives notifications from DQOps about 
the data quality incidents.

You can use this example to extend it and use the API provided by the vendor of a tool to pass on the message.

Please contact DQOps sales (https://dqops.com/contact-us/) about support of your incidents platform.
