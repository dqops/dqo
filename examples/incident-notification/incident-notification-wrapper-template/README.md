# Sample Incident Notification wrapper

This example is a simple Flask REST API application that receives notifications from DQOps about 
the data quality incidents.

You can use this example to extend it and pass on the incident notification message to the API provided by a vendor's tool.

Please contact DQOps sales (https://dqops.com/contact-us/) about support for your incidents platform.
