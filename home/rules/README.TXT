This is the root folder for rule definitions.
A rule is a Python script that verifies a data quality sensor readout (a data quality measure) and decides to accept the result or raise an alert.

Do not make changes to files in this folder. Copy the file to the same location in the DQO user's home folder and make a change.
DQO will prefer a user version of the definition.
