This is the root folder for sensor definitions. A sensor is a Jinja2 template that is an SELECT SQL statement that reads a measure (value) from a monitored table or column.

Do not make changes to files in this folder. Copy the file to the same location in the DQO user's home folder and make a change.
DQO will prefer a user version of the definition.
