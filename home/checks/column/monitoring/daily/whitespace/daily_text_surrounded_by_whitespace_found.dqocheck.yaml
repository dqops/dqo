  help_text: Detects text values that are surrounded by whitespace characters on any
    side. This check counts whitespace-surrounded texts and raises a data quality
    issue when their count exceeds the *max_count* parameter value. Stores the most
    recent captured value for each day when the data quality check was evaluated.
