This is the root folder for built-in check definitions.
DQO does not use these definitions during runtime. For built-in checks, DQO uses the definition of checks configured in the Java code.
The files in this folder are provided as a reference and a source of check definition samples when the user
decides to define a custom check that is similar to one of built-in checks (uses the same sensor or rule).
