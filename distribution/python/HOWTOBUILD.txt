How to build on Windows:

First, delete a local folder distribution\python\dqoai.egg-info
this folder may contain a cached list of files to go into the distribution.
Edit the dqoai\version.py file and update the version. The PIP_VERSION must be unique.

>>> Execute in the repository root:
mvnw -DskipTests clean package


>>> execute in a command line in distribution\python folder
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py -m build


>>> Publishing to test pypi:
py -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

>>> Publishing to the main pypi:
py -m twine upload dist/*

Testing with a test instance of pypi:
Run: pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ dqoai==0.1.0.1 --upgrade
where 0.1.0.1 is the version that was just published.
