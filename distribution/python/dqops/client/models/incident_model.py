class IncidentModel:
    """
    Attributes:
        incident_id (Union[Unset, str]): Incident ID - the primary key that identifies each data quality incident.
        connection (Union[Unset, str]): Connection name affected by a data quality incident.
        year (Union[Unset, int]): The year when the incident was first seen. This value is required to load an
            incident's monthly partition.
        month (Union[Unset, int]): The month when the incident was first seen. This value is required to load an
            incident's monthly partition.
        schema (Union[Unset, str]): Schema name affected by a data quality incident.
        table (Union[Unset, str]): Table name affected by a data quality incident.
        table_priority (Union[Unset, int]): Table priority of the table that was affected by a data quality incident.
        incident_hash (Union[Unset, int]): Data quality incident hash that identifies similar incidents on the same
            incident grouping level.
        first_seen (Union[Unset, int]): The UTC timestamp when the data quality incident was first seen.
        last_seen (Union[Unset, int]): The UTC timestamp when the data quality incident was last seen.
        incident_until (Union[Unset, int]): The UTC timestamp when the data quality incident is valid until. All new
            failed data quality check results until that date will be included in this incident, unless the incident status
            is changed to resolved, so a new incident must be created.
        data_group (Union[Unset, str]): The data group that was affected by a data quality incident.
        quality_dimension (Union[Unset, str]): The data quality dimension that was affected by a data quality incident.
        check_category (Union[Unset, str]): The data quality check category that was affected by a data quality
            incident.
        check_type (Union[Unset, str]): The data quality check type that was affected by a data quality incident.
        check_name (Union[Unset, str]): The data quality check name that was affected by a data quality incident.
        highest_severity (Union[Unset, int]): The highest failed check severity that was detected as part of this data
            quality incident. Possible values are: 1 - warning, 2 - error, 3 - fatal.
        minimum_severity (Union[Unset, int]): The minimum severity of the data quality incident, copied from the
            incident configuration at a connection or table at the time when the incident was first seen. Possible values
            are: 1 - warning, 2 - error, 3 - fatal.
        failed_checks_count (Union[Unset, int]): The total number of failed data quality checks that were seen when the
            incident was raised for the first time.
        issue_url (Union[Unset, str]): The link (url) to a ticket in an external system that is tracking this incident.
