    """The table's most recent data quality status. It is a summary of the results of the most recently executed data
    quality checks on the table. Verify the value of the highest_severity_issue (0 - all data quality checks passed, 1 -
    a warning was detected, 2 - an error was detected, 3 - a fatal data quality issue was detected.

        Attributes:
            connection_name (Union[Unset, str]): The connection name in DQOps.
            schema_name (Union[Unset, str]): The schema name.
            table_name (Union[Unset, str]): The table name.
            highest_severity_issue (Union[Unset, int]): The severity of the highest identified data quality issue (1 =
                warning, 2 = error, 3 = fatal) or 0 when no data quality issues were identified. This field will be null if no
                data quality checks were executed on the table.
            last_check_executed_at (Union[Unset, int]): The UTC timestamp when the most recent data quality check was
                executed on the table.
            executed_checks (Union[Unset, int]): The total number of most recent checks that were executed on the table.
                Table comparison checks that are comparing groups of data are counted as the number of compared data groups.
            valid_results (Union[Unset, int]): The number of most recent valid data quality checks that passed without
                raising any issues.
            warnings (Union[Unset, int]): The number of most recent data quality checks that failed by raising a warning
                severity data quality issue.
            errors (Union[Unset, int]): The number of most recent data quality checks that failed by raising an error
                severity data quality issue.
            fatals (Union[Unset, int]): The number of most recent data quality checks that failed by raising a fatal
                severity data quality issue.
            execution_errors (Union[Unset, int]): The number of data quality check execution errors that were reported due
                to access issues to the data source, invalid mapping in DQOps, invalid queries in data quality sensors or
                invalid python rules. When an execution error is reported, the configuration of a data quality check on a table
                must be updated.
            failed_checks_statuses (Union[Unset, TableDataQualityStatusModelFailedChecksStatuses]): The paths to all failed
                data quality checks (keys) and severity of the highest data quality issue that was detected. Table-level checks
                are identified by the check name. Column-level checks are identified as a check_name[column_name].
