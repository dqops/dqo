## :bug: Fixing a Bug

When fixing a bug please make sure to test it in several browsers including ie11. If you are not able to do so, mention that in a PR comment, so other contributors can do it. once your code is working please run the following command "eslint src/js" to verify that your code is following the same coding standards

## :tada: Proposing a Change

When implementing a feature please create an issue first explaining your idea and asking whether there's need for such a feature. Remember the script's core philosophy is to stay simple and minimal, doing one thing and doing it right.

## :pencil: Before you open a Pull Request
