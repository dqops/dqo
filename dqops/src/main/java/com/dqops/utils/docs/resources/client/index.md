# REST API and Python client

A running DQOps instance can be interacted with through the use of a RESTful API.
What's more, you can integrate the DQOps REST API with Python code using `dqops` package.

**Check out the guide underneath. It will walk you through the process of installing and interacting with DQOps through the Python client.**

## Connecting to DQOps

You can interact with DQOps REST API using one of the following methods:

1. [**curl**](#curl) - Direct HTTP method calls.
2. [**Python sync client**](#python-sync-client) - Unauthenticated synchronous Python client.
3. [**Python auth sync client**](#python-auth-sync-client) - Authenticated synchronous Python client.
4. [**Python async client**](#python-async-client) - Unauthenticated asynchronous Python client.
5. [**Python auth async client**](#python-auth-async-client) - Authenticated asynchronous Python client.

*You can find examples on how to execute each DQOps REST API operation in the [operations' documentation](./operations/index.md).*
